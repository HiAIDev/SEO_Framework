= Unbranded, Free and for the Professional =
This plugin is unbranded! This means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within the WordPress interface, aside from the plugin activation page. This plugin makes great use of the default WordPress interface elements, like as if this plugin is part of WordPress. No ads, no nags. The small and hidden HTML comments can easily be disabled with the use of a filter or extension.

Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your or someone else's website. A clean interface, for everyone.

= Completely automated =
**By default, this plugin automatically generates:**

* Titles according to your settings with archive prefixes.
* Descriptions with anti-spam techniques and detection that informs you when it can be improved.
* A canonical URL to prevent duplicated content; with full Domain Mapping, subdomain, and HTTPS support.
* Various Open Graph, Facebook and Twitter tags.
* Special Open Graph descriptions, which organically integrates within the Facebook and Twitter snippets.
* Open Graph images, they are automatically resized and optimized when needed.
* Structured Data for Google Search and Chromium that adds extended on-site search support.
* Structured Data for Google's Knowledge Graph; like Personal/Business site relations, names, and logos.
* Structured Data for Breadcrumbs that extend pages and categories relationship support in Google Search.
* Structured Data for Google Search that lets it know your preferred site name.
* Publishing and editing dates for Social Sites and Search Engines alike.
* Paginated content relationship links, to help visitors going to the right page.
* A sitemap with all your pages, posts and CPT, which listens to their set settings.
* Feed excerpts and backlinks within, to prevent automated content theft.

**This plugin goes further, behind the screens it:**

* Prevents canonical errors with categories, pages, subdomains and Multisite Domain Mapping.
* Discourages 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even if they don't send a 404 response.
* Automatically notifies Google, Bing, and Yandex on website updates when sitemaps are enabled.

= Generously personal =
**This plugin allows you to manually set various values for each post, page, public CPT, and term.**

**This plugin allows you to adjust over 100 site settings, including:**

* Automated title output options; they encourage you to follow the guidelines.
* Automated description output options.
* Schema.org Structured Data output options.
* Various robots meta output options.
* Many home page specific options.
* Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest social integration options.
* Google, Bing, Pinterest and Yandex Webmaster verification codes.
* Sitemap integration with personalization.
* Robots.txt sitemap integration.
* Feed anti-scraper options.
* And many, many more settings.

= Openly pluggable =
The SEO Framework has been built to go further than just itself.
Take a look at the API documentation located at [The SEO Framework API Docs](http://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= The SEO Bar =
**This plugin helps you to create better content, at a glance. By showing you:**

* If the title is too long, too short, duplicated, and/or automatically generated.
* If the description is too long, too short, duplicated, has too many repeated words and/or automatically generated.
* If the page is indexed, redirected, followed and/or archived, while looking at other WordPress settings.

**We call this The SEO Bar. Check out the [Screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/#screenshots) to see how it helps you!**

= Hardcore caching =
This plugin's code is highly optimized on PHP-level and uses variable, object and transient caching. This means that there's little extra page load time from this plugin, even with more meta tags used.

A caching plugin isn't even needed for this plugin as you won't notice a difference; however, it's supported wherever best suited.

= Compatibility =
**This plugin supports:**

* PHP 5.3 and higher.
* WordPress 4.4 and higher.
* Internationalization through WordPress.org.
* Multibyte calculation and rendering, including Emoji and CJK.
* Right to Left (RTL) languages, through its interface and generation.
* Extended color vision deficiency accessibility.
* Screen reader accessibility.
* MultiSite, this plugin is in fact built upon one.
* Detection of robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.
* Both up-to-date and outdated themes.
* Detection of various other popular SEO tools to prevent duplicated output.
* Translation plugins WPML, Polylang and qTranslate X.
* WooCommerce, for free, in all its glory.

= An additional sitemap =
The sitemap generated with The SEO Framework is sufficient for Search Engines to find posts, pages and supported custom post types throughout your website. It also listens to the "noindex" settings on each of the items and works great with various translation plugins.

However, if you require a more expanded sitemap, feel free to activate a dedicated Sitemap plugin. The SEO Framework will automatically deactivate its Sitemap functionality when another (known) sitemap plugin is found. If it is not automatically detected and no notification has been provided in the Sitemap Settings, feel free to open a support ticket and it will be addressed carefully.

= Hidden breadcrumbs =
The Breadcrumb script generated by this plugin on Posts will also make sure Google easily finds related categories which aren't included in the Sitemap of this plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework Free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads or nags!

= Is there a Premium version? =

Nope! This plugin is all-inclusive.

= Free & Premium Extensions =

For more advanced SEO options and output, we offer the free plugin [Extension Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-extension-manager/).

= I have a feature request, I've found a bug, a plugin is incompatible... =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell me about it. I try to get back to you within 48 hours. :)

= Is this really a Framework? =

The SEO Framework is its own self-serving technical framework. It keeps track of everything WordPress and SEO while it allows other plugins to interact with it easily.
Through its framework it allows you to SEO your complete website. It also allows for extensions and real-time alterations; for when you really want or need to change something.
Extensions built for this plugin might just as well work as a standalone; however, The SEO Framework provides an easier and faster way of doing so.

= I am a developer; how can I help? =

The SEO Framework is currently a one-man project. However, any input is greatly appreciated and everything will be considered.
Please visit the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework) to submit issues or even pull requests.

= I want to modify how this plugin works =

The SEO Framework is very pluggable in many fields. Please refer to the [API documentation](https://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, news, etc. is this OK? =

This is not an issue. Search Engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.
If a visitor can't find a page, then why would a Search Engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's usability.

= What's do the application/ld+json scripts do? =

The JSON-LD scripts are Search Engine helpers which tell Search Engines how to connect and index the site.
They can tell the Search Engine if your site contains an internal search engine, what sites you're socially connected to and what page structure you're using.
This is also referred to as Structured Data.

= The metadata is not being updated, and I'm using a caching plugin. =

All The SEO Framework's metadata is put into Object cache when a caching plugin is available. The descriptions and Schema.org scripts are put into Transients. Please be sure to clear your cache.

= I want to transport SEO data from other plugins to The SEO Framework, how do I do this? =

Please refer to this small guide: [SEO Data Migration](http://theseoframework.com/docs/seo-data-migration/).
Transporting Terms and Taxonomies SEO data isn't supported.

== Changelog ==

= 3.0.0 - TODO =

**Release date:**
/
* TODO TODO-th, 2017

**Summarized:**
/
* TODO

* **For everyone:**
	* **Added:**
		* Author SEO options. This is great for websites that utilize multiple authors.
			* They take precedence over the global authorial (now fallback) options, when filled in.
			* On every profile page, if the user can publish posts, these options are found under "Authorial Info":
				* "Facebook profile page"
				* "Twitter profile page"
		* A global timestamp format option. It affects:
			* Sitemap's `lastmod` output.
			* Article published and modified time.
			* Open Graph updated time.
		* Primary term settings have been added to each post supporting hierarchical taxonomies.
			* This setting is represented through buttons within the category selection meta box.
			* This setting affects the URL structure of the post.
			* This setting affects the breadcrumb structure of the post.
		/
		* TODO New sitename options, that are now named Organization options.
		* TODO Split Person/Organization SEO?
		* TODO Logo upload has been added for Organization Schema.org.
			* Current customizer logo settings are still (too) theme-specific.
			* The output will still fall back to the customizer logo when not set.
		* SEO title placeholders and counters now update when:
		 	* Changing post visibility (private, protected, public).
			* Changing the page title.
			* Note that the example is not a perfect analogy. Sanitation is a complex process and sending it back-and-forth through AJAX can be heavy on the server.
		* Pixel counters!
			* A pixel counter is like a character counter, but it's far more accurate. This is because not all characters have the same length. e.g. A `W` is much wider than an `i`.
			* These counters show the true length of what Google renders, represented through a bar.
			* If the bar is green, your title or description will likely fit.
			* If the bar is red, your title or description will likely be truncated.
			* The bar grows as more space is filled in.
			* The bar shrinks as more characters are truncated.
		* Counter settings:
			* The character and pixel counters can be enabled and disabled in the General meta box, under the Layout settings.
			* For new sites, by default:
				* The character counter is disabled.
				* The pixel counter is enabled.
			* For sites that have been upgraded from earlier TSF versions, by default:
				* Both counters are enabled.
		* Super singular breadcrumbs:
			* Breadcrumbs now automatically support all hierarchical post types. Like WooCommerce products.
			* These breadcrumbs will listen to the new primary term settings.
	* **Changed:**
		* Titles:
			* When no blog tagline is set, in either WordPress' General Settings or in TSF's Home Page settings, "Untitled" is no longer used for the Home Page.
		* Structured Data:
			* Schema breadcrumbs now have their IDs reset. They have an URL fragment attached (e.g. `example.com/#schemaorg-bcl`).
				* This is to prevent ID collision with generated scripts from other plugins, like WooCommerce 3.0+.
				* This might affect search presence of the pages until the new IDs have been processed by the search engine, like Google and Bing.
			* Only one breadcrumb script is now generated, and it listens to the new primary category settings.
				* If a primary category is set, the tree related to the category is used and will stop at the primary category.
				* Otherwise, the longest tree of the first base category found is used (numerical).
		* Sitemap:
			* The sitemap `lastmod` option no longer listens to Post Dates settings. But now only to its own specific setting.
		* Feeds:
			* Default link back to source in feed content no longer check settings. Instead, it uses the default WordPress permalink.
		* Layout:
			* Character counters on term edit pages have been moved to the left.
	* **Improved:**
		* Titles:
			* Refactored "floating title placeholder"'s code, this means it no longer "glues" every part together based on assumption to perform calculations and placements.
				/
				* This made way for new features, it improved performance, and it lowered overall lower maintenance cost.
				* TODO test RTL.
		* Canonical URLS:
			* Sped up URL generation two-fold. We've rewritten the code from the ground up.
			* The Canonical URL should now always be compatible with any plugin, out of the box.
			* Note that these URLs no longer output anything on private posts, and some layout elements have been affected.
			* If a query isn't registered incorrectly, the URL will also stay empty.
			* The canonical URLs now listen to the new "Primary Term" options.
		* Sitemaps:
			* Password protected posts and pages no longer show up in the sitemap.
		* Upgrade:
			* When TSF's database needs upgrading, it now requires fewer database calls.
			* After-upgrade notifications now have "SEO: " prefixed.
		* Layout:
			* The homepage in-post SEO settings box now links to the settings page when the user can view those options.
			* Facebook and Twitter Social Meta Settings input now show initial placeholders when emptied.
			* The counter type update buttons on taxonomical edit screens no longer stretch to the adjacent input length.
			* In-post SEO box active tab's shadow now has the same color as the used admin button color scheme.
				/
				* TODO test RTL.
			* Polished many admin sentences, improving verbatim and expounding better of what options do.
		* Admin performance:
			* Sped up admin JavaScript initialization by combining jQuery overhead calls.
			* "Floating title placeholders" now move smoother on resize.
			* Slightly improved CSS rendering performance by eliminating clause-calls; i.e. we now use `.class` instead of `div.class` and derivatives thereof.
				/
				* TODO RTL.
		* Archives:
			* Adjusted the search and archive query alteration database query.
				* This speeds this process up marginally for small and significantly for large sites.
				* This improves compatibility with themes and plugins that don't merge these queries, or when they adjust the query comparator.
				* How it works: Instead of a demanding in-database joining-then-excluding comparison, it now uses a cached and lightweight preemptive-exclusive comparison.
		* Privacy:
			* Informational links (e.g. to Google's webmaster pages) are no longer tracked.
		* Tooltips have been reworked and expanded:
			* `[?]` help tooltips now pop up instantly through these.
			* Tapping tooltips in Edge no longer makes them go away instantly.
			* Tooltips no longer look super-slim on smaller screens, and now have a minimum-width assigned.
			* Tooltips no longer overflow the screen, instead they'll find boundaries.
				* This automatically ensures compatibility with the new Gutenberg editor.
			* We are aware that these tooltips invoke various Chrome browser "violations".
				* These violations are a warning sign preventing bad practices hindering user experience, which are alleviated.
				* In practice, WordPress Core needs to update to a future jQuery version to stop these warnings from showing up.
	* **Updated:**
		/
		* TODO All transient caches for The SEO Framework have been invalidated.
			* Done (recheck as we add new options): LD-JSON.
			* TODO: Description, sitemap.
	* **Removed:**
		* Robots:
			* The DMOZ project that it influenced is no longer available nor used, so:
				* `noodp` and all its settings.
		/
		* TODO The Site Name project has been abandoned, and this data is now accumulated automatically, so:
			* `ld_json_sitename` and all its settings.
		* Open Graph:
			* Open graph type `blog`. It's no longer supported. `website` is used instead.
			* The Open Graph protocol no longer allows `article:published_time` on `website` types, so:
				* `page_publish_time` and all its settings.
				* `home_publish_time` and all its settings.
			*  The Open Graph protocol no longer allows `article:modified_time` on `website` types, so:
				* `page_modify_time` and all its settings.
				* `home_modify_time` and all its settings.
		* Sitemaps:
			* Sitemaps timestamp format option. It will be converted to the new global timestamp format option upon upgrade.
		* Compatibility:
			* Polylang URL compatibility file. It now works without it.
			* WPML URL enhancements. It now works without these.
			* qTranslate X URL compatibility file. It now works without it.
			* Donncha Domain Mapping URL compatibility file. Be sure to set a preferred canonical scheme.
			* WPMUdev Mapping URL generation enhancements and compatibility file. Be sure to set a preferred canonical scheme.
			/
			* TSF uses newer JavaScript and CSS techniques. TODO: We now use ES5.1 and CSS3 snapshot 2015.
				* This improves admin performance and lowers memory consumption: less jQuery, more vanilla.
				* To evade polyfilling and massive spaghetti, older browsers are therefore abandoned in support.
				* The following browsers are no longer supported:
					/
					* TODO confirm this list, this is based on assumptions.
					* Internet explorer 10 and below.
					* Safari 9 and below.
					* All browsers on iOS 9 and below.
					* Chrome 53 and below.
					* Firefox 48 and below.
					* NOTE: This only accounts for the WordPress administrative dashboard. This change doesn't affect your website visitors.
	* **Fixed:**
		* Security:
			* An XSS issue has been resolved.
		* Sitemaps:
			* XSL stylesheet no longer prepends query arguments, but instead appends them. This fixes, for example, issues when using WPML query string parameters.
		* Open Graph:
			* `article:publisher` is now only output on `article` types.
		* CPT:
			* Custom Post Type archives now fetch and render custom SEO data.
		* Images:
			* Now all image URLs convert to the correct scheme when the image URL contains the site's domain.
		* Compatibility:
			* TSF no longer outputs canonical URLs on BuddyPress pages. Instead, it lets BuddyPress output them.
			* [Simple Sitemap](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-sitemap/) is no longer detected as a conflicting sitemap plugin.
			* [NextScripts Snap](https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-networks-auto-poster-facebook-twitter-g/) is no longer detected as a conflicting Open Graph plugin, they now inform you about this.
		* Layout:
			/
			* When an empty description is supplied, the counter will now display `0` instead of nothing.
			* Cyrillic texts JavaScript compatibility. TODO confirm.
		/
		* TODO Odd database call on front-end looking for image... while custom is set...?
		* TODO - New bug: Primary category selector with Genesis active (and scrollbar), must move the `[?]`. Also, the deselect "all" button doesn't affect the radio buttons.
		* TODO Separator selection description no longer overflows on EdgeHTML.
	* **Noted:**
		* Ticket [42390](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42390#ticket) also affects TSF input fields.

* **For developers:**
	* **Added:**
		* Class `The_SEO_Framework\User_Data`. Maintains user data.
		* Class `The_SEO_Framework\Profile`. Maintains admin profile pages.
		* Method `can_access_settings()`, to easily determine if the current user has rights to edit global SEO settings.
		* Property `$schema_ids`, it allows you to adjust used Schema.org JSON-LD script IDs.
		* Method `s_numeric_string()`, it creates a string from integers. Rounds float down. Converts non-numeric input to `'0'`, arrays and objects to `'1'`.
		* Method `s_facebook_profile()`, it converts any URL or string-input into a Facebook profile URL.
