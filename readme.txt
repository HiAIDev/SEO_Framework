= Unbranded, Free and for the Professional =
This plugin is unbranded! This means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within the WordPress interface, aside from the plugin activation page.
This plugin makes great use of the default WordPress interface elements, like as if this plugin is part of WordPress. No ads, no nags.
The small and hidden HTML comment can easily be disabled with the use of a filter or extension.

Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your or someone else's website. A clean interface, for everyone.

= Completely automated =
**By default, this plugin automatically generates:**

* Title, with super-fast 'wrong themes' support.
* Description, with anti-spam techniques.
* A canonical URL, with full WPMUdev Domain Mapping, subdomain and HTTPS support to prevent duplicated content.
* Various Open Graph, Facebook and Twitter tags.
* Special Open Graph description, which organically integrates with the Facebook and Twitter snippets.
* Extended Open Graph Images support, including automated image manipulation.
* Schema.org JSON-LD script that adds extended search support for Google Search and Chrome.
* Schema.org JSON-LD script for Knowledge Graph (Personal/Business site relations, name and logo).
* Advanced Schema.org JSON-LD script for Breadcrumbs (just like the visual one) which extends page relation support in Google Search.
* Schema.org JSON-LD script to show the correct site name in Google Breadcrumbs.
* Publishing and editing dates, accurate to the day.
* Link relationships, with full WPMUdev Domain Mapping and HTTPS support.
* Simple Sitemap with Pages, Posts and Custom Post Types (CPT), which listens to the in-post settings.
* Feed excerpts and backlinks to prevent content scraping.

**This plugin goes further, behind the screens it:**

* Prevents canonical errors with categories, pages, subdomains and Multisite Domain Mapping.
* Discourages 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even if they don't send a 404 response.
* Automatically notifies Google, Bing and Yandex on Post or Page update and deletion when sitemaps are enabled.

= Generously personal =
**This plugin allows you to manually set various values for each post, page, public CPT and term.**

**This plugin allows you to adjust over 90 site settings, including:**

* Title and Description Separators and additions.
* Automated description output.
* Schema.org output, including Knowledge Graph options.
* Various robots' options.
* Many home page specific options.
* Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest social integration
* Shortlink tag output.
* Link relationships
* Google, Bing, Pinterest and Yandex Webmaster verification
* Sitemap integration.
* Robots.txt sitemap integration.
* Feed anti-scraper options.
* And many, many more settings.

= Openly pluggable =
The SEO Framework has been built to go further than just itself.
Take a look at the API documentation located at [The SEO Framework API Docs](http://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= The SEO Bar =
**This plugin helps you to create better content, at a glance. By showing you:**

* If the title is too long, too short, duplicated, and/or automatically generated.
* If the description is too long, too short, duplicated, has too many repeated words and/or automatically generated.
* If the page is indexed, redirected, followed and/or archived, while looking at other WordPress settings.

**We call this The SEO Bar. Check out the [Screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/screenshots/#plugin-info) to see how it helps you!**

= Hardcore caching =
This plugin's code is highly optimized on PHP-level and uses variable, object and transient caching. This means that there's little extra page load time from this plugin, even with more Meta tags used.
A caching plugin isn't even needed for this plugin as you won't notice a difference, however it's supported wherever best suited.

= Compatibility =

* Full internationalization support through WordPress.org.
* Extended Multibyte support (CJK).
* Full Right to Left (RTL) language support.
* Extended Color vision deficiency accessibility.
* Screen reader accessibility.
* MultiSite, this plugin is in fact built upon one.
* Detection of robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.
* Detection of theme Title output "doing it right" (or wrong).
* Automatic detection of various other popular SEO tools.

**If you have other popular SEO plugins activated, this plugin will automatically prevent SEO mistakes by deactivating itself on almost every part.**

= An additional sitemap =
The Sitemap generated with The SEO Framework is sufficient for Search Engines to find Posts, Pages and supported Custom Post Types throughout your website.
It also listens to the noindex settings on each of the items.
If you however require a more expanded Sitemap, feel free to activate a dedicated Sitemap plugin. The SEO Framework will automatically deactivate its Sitemap functionality when another (known) Sitemap plugin is found.
If it is not automatically detected and no notification has been provided on the Sitemap Settings, feel free to open a support ticket and it will be addressed carefully.

= Hidden breadcrumbs =
The Breadcrumb script generated by this plugin on Posts will also make sure Google easily finds related categories which aren't included within the Sitemap of this plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Install The SEO Framework either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.
1. Either Network Activate this plugin or activate it on a single site.
1. That's it!
1. Let the plugin automatically work or fine-tune each page with the metaboxes beneath the content or on the taxonomy pages.
1. Adjust the SEO settings through the SEO settings page if desired. Red checkboxes are rather left unchecked. Green checkboxes are default enabled.

== Screenshots ==

1. This plugin shows you what you can improve, at a glance. With full color vision deficiency support.
2. Hover over any of the SEO Bar's items to see how you can improve the page's SEO. Red is bad, orange is okay, green is good. Blue is situational.
3. The dynamic Post/Page SEO settings Metabox. This box is also neatly implemented in Categories and Tags.
4. The SEO Settings Page. With over 90 settings, you are in full control. Using the Default Settings and filling in the Knowledge Graph Settings and Social Meta Settings is recommended to do.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework Free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads or nags!

= I have a feature request, I've found a bug, a plugin is incompatible... =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell me about it. I try to get back to you within 48 hours. :)

= Is this really a Framework? =

This plugin is not in particular a framework in a technical sense, but it is built with a framework's mindset. It is however a framework for your website's SEO, a building block that keeps everything together.
This means that this plugin will do all the great Search Engine Optimization, and also allows for extensions and real-time alterations. For when you really want or need to change something.
Extensions built for this plugin might just as well work as a standalone. The SEO Framework provides an easier and cached way of doing so, however.

= I am a developer; how can I help? =

The SEO Framework is currently a one-man project. However, any input is greatly appreciated and everything will be considered.
Please leave feature requests in the Support Forums and I will talk you through the process of implementing it if necessary.

= I want to remove or change stuff, but I can't find an option! =

The SEO Framework is very pluggable on many fields. Please refer to the [Other Notes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/other_notes/).
Please note that a free plugin is underway which will allow you to change all filters from the dashboard. No ETA yet.

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, news, etc. is this OK? =

This is not an issue. Search Engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.
If a visitor can't find a page, then why would a Search Engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's usability.

= What's does the application/ld+json script do? =

The JSON-LD scripts are Search Engine helpers which tell Search Engines how to connect and index the site. They can tell the Search Engine if your site contains an internal search engine, what sites you're socially connected to and what page structure you're using.

= The meta data is not being updated, and I'm using a caching plugin. =

All The SEO Framework's metadata is put into Object cache when a caching plugin is available. The descriptions and Schema.org scripts are put into Transients. Please be sure to clear your cache.

= I want to transport SEO data from other plugins to The SEO Framework, how do I do this? =

Please refer to this small guide: [SEO Data Migration](http://theseoframework.com/docs/seo-data-migration/).
Transporting Terms and Taxonomies SEO data isn't supported.

== Changelog ==

= 2.9.0 - ??? =

**Release date:**
/ TODO

**Summarized:**
/ TODO

* **For everyone:**
	* **Added:**
		/
		* TODO The inpost SEO settings are now devided in tabs.
			* This allows me to add more options in the near future, either through this plugin or even extensions.
			* Stay tuned on its enhanced implementation!
		* [Schema.org sitename](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/sitename) `alternateName` output.
			* This name is now also considered by Google.
			* This name is only set if the Organization or Personal Name option is filled in and when it's not idential to the site name.
		/
		* TODO The home page has a new tab: Social Settings.
			* In which you can set your favorite social image.
			* This image is used on Open Graph, Twitter and Schema metadata.
		* The SEO meta object cache is now flushed on SEO settings save, when available and enabled.
	* **Improved:**
		* Post overview SEO Bar data rendering is a lot lighter now.
	* **Changed:**
		* A source link is no longer generated on feed entries without content.
	* **Updated:**
		/
		* TODO Several Google documentation links have changed, including:
			/
			* TODO
	* **Removed:**
		* Twitter `photo` card. This has been deprecated and has been replaced with `summary_large_image`.
			* All related options and outputs have been updated.
			* When updating the plugin the upgrade handler will scan for the photo card option, and will change it to `summar_large_image` if it's `photo`.
	* **Fixed:**
		/
		* The terms and taxonomies SEO bar now correctly displays robots values again.
		* When emptying the Home Page Custom title, the Additions are now correctly updated once again.
		* The feed excerpt generation and original content link generation work again.
			* The call was misplaced. Sorry about that!
		/
		* When emptying the floating title (while it's being on the right), the placeholder no longer jumps or animates.
		* When the Home Page Settings metabox is closed on load, the dynamic placeholder is now no longer stacked when opened.
		* TODO When moving your mouse up fast over The SEO Bar, some tooltips could've possibly hung.
		* TODO When on mobile, when you tap on a second or later SEO Bar, the arrow could've been moved off-screen when the first entry was closed.
		* RTL: When Title additions have been set to "Right", the indentation of the title no longer shifts all the way to the left.
		* RTL: The Dynamic Title for the home page was reversed.
		* bbPress topic tags now (mostly) output the correct data.

* **For translators:**
	* **Updated:**
		/
		* TODO POT translation file.
			* Translations are handled through [WordPress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/autodescription).
	* **Changed:**
		* "Adding a backlink below the feed's content will also let the visitors know where the content came from."
			* Now is: "Adding a backlink below the feed entries will also let the visitors know where the content came from."
			* Clarity: A feed is a list, a feed entry is a part.
		* "Convert feed content into excerpts?"
			* Now is: "Convert feed entries into excerpts?"
			* Clarity: A feed is a list, a feed entry is a part.
		* "Add backlinks below the feed content?"
			* Now is: "Add link to source below the feed content?"
			* Vague: Backlinks are an SEO term (which the option doesn't affect), rather than a litterally implied thing (which it actually is).
		* "The shortlink tag might have some use for 3rd party service discoverability, but it has little to no SEO value whatsoever."
			* Now is: "The shortlink tag can be manually used for microblogging services like Twitter, but it has no SEO value whatsoever."
			* Vague: Even I couldn't explain it. Also, no prominently known services use the tag (anymore).
			* Altered: Added the word "manually", because you're better off manually copying it from the source code for shortening the URL; e.g. for Twitter.
			* Altered: "little to no" now is "no", because it really has no SEO value.

* **For developers:**
	* **Added:**
		* (JavaScript) A triggered event after The SEO Framework's jQuery code has been initiatlized: `tsf-ready`.
		* Method `do_redirect()`. Only use this on action `template_redirect`.
		* Method `update_option`, allows for easily updating single SEO options. Use `update_settings` if you wish to update multiple option values at once.
		* Method `delete_object_cache`, allows for easily deleting The SEO Framework object cache.
	* **Improved:**
		* (JavaScript) `tsf.dynamicPlaceholderOnLoad` has been removed and is no longer called. It caused a duplicated method call.
			* It has been removed from the protected externs file too.
		* A doing it wrong notice is now displayed when a query-capable method is called too early, which is therefore error-prone.
			* All internal methods that did it wrong have been adjusted accordingly.
			* This is mainly added for internal debugging purposes, but might eliminate external plugin errors.
	* **Removed:**
		* Method `init_feed()`, it's now `_init_feed_output()` and is now marked private.
		* Method `custom_field_redirect()`, it's now `_init_custom_field_redirect()` and is now marked private.
	* **Changed:**
		* Method `delete_main_cache()` now flushes SEO Meta object cache too.
		* Method `get_warned_site_options()` no longer returns non-warned settings keys. This reduces plugin memory usage.
	* **Fixed:**
		* Method `the_seo_framework()->get_social_image_url_from_post_meta()` second parameter now works.
	* **Filter Notes:**
		* **Added:**
			/
			* `(bool) the_seo_framework_use_breadcrumb_seo_title`, determines whether to use custom SEO titles or WordPress set only.
			* `(string) the_seo_framework_custom_field_description`, alters the Description from custom field.
			* `(string) the_seo_framework_generated_description`, alters the generated Description.
			* `(string) the_seo_framework_fetched_description_excerpt`, alters the excerpt to use for generating a description.
			* `(int) the_seo_framework_current_admin_id`, allows changing of the admin query ID.
			* `(array) the_seo_framework_available_twitter_cards`, lists the available Twitter cards. Not index sensitive.
