= Unbranded, Free and for the Professional =
This plugin is unbranded! This means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within the WordPress interface, aside from the plugin activation page. This plugin makes great use of the default WordPress interface elements, like as if this plugin is part of WordPress. No ads, no nags. The small and hidden HTML comments can easily be disabled with the use of a filter or extension.

Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your or someone else's website. A clean interface, for everyone.

= Completely automated =
**By default, this plugin automatically generates:**

* Titles according to your settings with archive prefixes.
* Descriptions with anti-spam techniques and detection that informs you when it can be improved.
* A canonical URL to prevent duplicated content; with full "domain mapping", subdomain, and HTTPS support.
* Various Open Graph, Facebook and Twitter tags.
* Special Open Graph descriptions, which organically integrates within the Facebook and Twitter snippets.
* Open Graph images, they are automatically resized and optimized when needed.
* Structured Data for Google Search and Chromium that adds extended on-site search support.
* Structured Data for Google's Knowledge Graph; like Personal/Business site relations, names, and logos.
* Structured Data for Breadcrumbs that extend pages and categories relationship support in Google Search.
* Structured Data for Google Search that lets it know your preferred site name.
* Publishing and editing dates for social sites and search engines alike.
* Paginated content relationship links, to help visitors going to the right page.
* A sitemap with all your pages, posts and CPT, which listens to their page settings.
* Feed excerpts and backlinks within, to reduce automated content theft.

**This plugin goes further, behind the screens it:**

* Prevents canonical errors with categories, pages, subdomains and Multisite Domain Mapping.
* Discourages 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even if they don't send a 404 response.
* Automatically notifies Google, Bing, and Yandex on website updates when sitemaps are enabled.

= Generously personal =
**This plugin allows you to manually set various values for each post, page, public CPT, and term.**

**This plugin allows you to adjust over 100 site settings, including:**

* Automated title output options; they encourage you to follow the guidelines.
* Automated description output options.
* Schema.org structured data output options.
* Various robots meta output options.
* Many home page specific options.
* Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest social integration options.
* Google, Bing, Pinterest and Yandex webmaster verification codes.
* Sitemap integration with personalization.
* Robots.txt sitemap integration.
* Feed anti-scraper options.
* And many, many more settings.

= Openly pluggable =
The SEO Framework has been built to go further than just itself.
Take a look at the API documentation located at [The SEO Framework API Docs](http://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= The SEO Bar =
**This plugin helps you to create better content, at a glance. By showing you:**

* If the title is too long, too short, duplicated, and/or automatically generated.
* If the description is too long, too short, duplicated, has too many repeated words and/or automatically generated.
* If the page is indexed, redirected, followed and/or archived, while looking at other WordPress settings.

**We call this the SEO Bar. Check out the [Screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/#screenshots) to see how it helps you!**

= Hardcore caching =
This plugin's code is highly optimized on PHP-level and uses variable, object and transient caching. This means that there's little extra page load time from this plugin, even with more meta tags used.

A caching plugin isn't even needed for this plugin as you won't notice a difference; however, it's supported wherever best suited.

= Compatibility =
**This plugin supports:**

* PHP 5.4 and higher.
* WordPress 4.6 and higher.
* Internationalization through WordPress.org.
* Multibyte calculation and rendering, including Emoji and CJK.
* Right to Left (RTL) languages, through its interface and generation.
* Extended color vision deficiency accessibility.
* Screen reader accessibility.
* Multisite, this plugin is in fact built upon one.
* Detection of robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.
* Both up-to-date and outdated themes.
* Detection of various other popular SEO tools to prevent duplicated output.
* Translation plugins like WPML, Polylang, WPGlobus and MultilingualPress.
* WooCommerce, for free, in all its glory.

= An additional sitemap =
The sitemap generated with The SEO Framework is sufficient for search engines to find posts, pages and supported custom post types throughout your website. It also listens to the "noindex" settings on each of the items and works great with various translation plugins.

However, if you require a more expanded sitemap, feel free to activate a dedicated Sitemap plugin. The SEO Framework will automatically deactivate its Sitemap functionality when another (known) sitemap plugin is found. If it is not automatically detected and no notification has been provided in the Sitemap Settings, feel free to open a support ticket and it will be addressed carefully.

= Hidden breadcrumbs =
The Breadcrumb script generated by this plugin on Posts will also make sure Google easily finds related categories which aren't included in the Sitemap of this plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework Free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads or nags!
This plugin is all-inclusive without upsells.

= Is there more? =

For more advanced SEO options and output, we offer the free plugin [Extension Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-extension-manager/).

= I have a feature request, I've found a bug, a plugin is incompatible... =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell us about it.
We'll try to get back to you within 72 hours. :)

= I am a developer; how can I help? =

Any input is greatly appreciated, and everything will be considered.
Please visit the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework) to submit issues or even pull requests.

= I want to modify how this plugin works. =

The SEO Framework is very pluggable in many fields. Please refer to the [API documentation](https://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, news, etc. is this OK? =

This is not an issue. Search engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.
If a visitor can't find a page, then why would a search engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's usability.

Check out our [Extension Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-extension-manager/).
It contains extensions, like Articles, that fill in the gaps with newer techniques.

= The sitemap contains unwanted links. =

The SEO Framework takes all publicly queryable posts, pages, and CPT and puts them in the sitemap.

If you don't want a page in the sitemap, consider enabling the `noindex` option. This will also remove the page from search engine result pages.

If the link shouldn't be in the sitemap because it's meant for structural reasons, then inform the plugin or theme author that created them.
You should tell the author to check out the "`public` and `rewrite` post type arguments". The plugin or theme author should know that that means.

= What's do the application/ld+json scripts do? =

The JSON-LD scripts are search engine helpers which tell search engines how to connect and index the site.
They can tell the search engine if your site contains an internal search engine, what sites you're socially connected to and what page structure you're using.
This is also referred to as "Structured Data".

= The metadata is not being updated, and I'm using a caching plugin. =

All The SEO Framework's metadata is put into Object cache when a caching plugin is available.
The descriptions and Schema.org scripts are put into Transients.
Please be sure to clear your cache or adjust the plugin's caching settings if deemed necessary.

= I want to transport SEO data from other plugins to The SEO Framework, how do I do this? =

Please refer to this small guide: [SEO Data Migration](http://theseoframework.com/docs/seo-data-migration/).
Transporting Categories, Tags and other terms' SEO data isn't supported.

== Changelog ==

= 3.1.0 - TODO =

**Release date**

* August TODOth, 2018

NOTE: ref: https://theseoframework.com/?p=1792

1. PHP 5.3 support has been dropped. Here's why:
	* TODO
2. The minimum required WordPress version now is 4.6. Here's why:
	* TODO

**Feature highlights:**

* TODO

**Summarized:**

* Like previous updates, this update...
* TODO

**For everyone: Better and faster titles**

* Over the years, the title generation code became bigger, unsustainable, and eventually unmaintainable. So, it's now rewritten to almost half its previous size, being more straightforward and logical, without sacrificing any important features. In fact, we've added new features.
* With this rewrite, we're embracing what WordPress has to offer in its title translations and API hooks. So, you can expect much greater compatibility with other plugins and your favorite language.
* Having conditional additions to the title was the most requested feature, and that's now also available.
* TODO notify that the title detection is removed, and the user might find title fix useful. TODO consider title fix integration?
* For developers, note that this change heavily affects the title generation API. Although this change deems API adjustments less necessary, if you've used title functions or filters within this plugin and still need them, then go see the detailed log for needed adjustments. TODO make write-up, consider old features.

**For everyone: Plugin conflict resolution**

* The SEO Framework no longer disables parts of its meta output, settings and other functionality when a conflicting plugin is found.
* Now, only warnings are shown in the settings page.
* Most users aren't affected by this. However, if you think you're using any of [these plugins](TODO), you might wish to revise your settings.
* TODO show the user a list of plugins in the plugin activation page?
* We made this change because it was confusing to many users; the plugin even seemed broken.

**For developers: About the API**

* We've removed or otherwise deprecated most API functions. We've done this to lower maintenance time drastically.
* We encourage you to always use the factory function `the_seo_framework()`. Via this factory function, you can access all API methods when needed.
* The factory function yields many failsafe capturers so we can make future changes with peace of mind. This isn't possible with PHP functions.
* As more than three quarters the plugin's code is dormant on most pages, in future major releases we're going to cut off the "façade" class loading (where everything's accessible via `$this`), and split them into interfacing factories, e.g.: `the_seo_framework()->generate( 'url' )::set( 'id', 1 )::get( 'relative' )`. More on this will follow for 3.2 or later after a class-map draft is set up. Or goal is to minimize performance overhead; aiming to improve it further. TODO revise this.

**For developers: HTML Script changes:**

* The original JS file (stemming from August 2015) was a God Object container, which grew over 3000 lines of code. So, we split the code over multiple objects, thus files, to improve maintainability and added a script loader.
* Theoretically, we could've auto-combined the files in the loader (like WP `load-scripts.php` does), but we figured most servers use HTTP/2 now. And, if they don't, they should.
* With this introduction, most of the split-off code's API has been dropped, without deprecation. We plan to incorporate the new API into the Extension Manager, which now maintains its own versions of almost everything.
* We've also removed the externs file, as we long moved to Babel instead of Closure Compiler.

## Detailed log

TODO: RTL stylesheet update.
TODO: Follow progression of https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/pull/9912, and see if we might need to implement it ourselves.
	Track/adjust readme changes: --JETPACK
TODO: Regression: Title compatibility --UltimateMember has been fixed thus far.

* **For everyone:**
	* **Added:**
		* TODO
		* New title options, including:
			* TODO Manual 404 title.
			* TODO Manual search results prefix.
			* TODO A toggle that disabled title additions when a manual title is used.
			* TODO Paginated Title separator
		* TODO A title check is added next to every title field. (or the SEO bar... a red title tsunami)
			* It informs you when your theme uses outdated standards, and that you should use the Title Fix extension.
			* TODO consider using methods that are used in Theme Check.
			* TODO make sure it's in a non-expiring transient that might store a md5 checksum value of the theme file, which is cleared on theme switch or update. TODO rethink this... we shouldn't hinder performance, and not all PHP installations allow file reading.
			* TODO make sure it checks for Title Fix' presence.
		* TODO New robots options that allow setting robots for each post type.
		* TODO New sitemap options that allow setting including for each post type.
		* TODO Doing it Right conditions for Private, Protected, Draft...
		* TODO New option that prevents automated descriptions.
		* Descriptive links to the in-post-edit meta title and description labels.
	* **Improved:**
		* TODO
		* The plugin can now downgrade its database version to the currently installed version automatically. This makes sure necessary future upgrade procedures are reinstated when you choose to downgrade (for any reason).
			* Since TSF v3.0.6 this happens when a user saved the options, but this could lead to inconsistent behavior on WordPress Multisite installations.
		* We removed a lot of redundant code (like option upgrade checks), which have long been superseded by better standards.
		* Code and URL input types (Twitter profile, Webmasters' verification codes) now always flow from left to right, even if your site's written language setting is otherwise.
		* Tooltip arrows now always follow your mouse, for a more natural look.
		* Tooltips now support RTL screens without the arrow overflowing.
		* Canonical, redirect, and image URLs are no longer uselessly suggested by the browser.
		* TODO Beaver Builder templates are no longer in the sitemap. (not my fault...) `example.com/fl-builder-template/title/...`
		* TODO bbPress replies are no longer in the sitemap. (technically, neither our fault).
		* TODO https://wordpress.org/support/topic/problem-with-title-3/#post-10410406 fix link and verbatim, the "verified" business profile can now be any business page, even without instant articles.
		* TODO Open Graph data validation (e.g. missing descriptions).
		* TODO Doing it right check for empty description. Make it blue to ask if they intended it to be this way.
			* This definitely occurs when the post is private, and no custom description is set.
		* TODO Doing it right check for empty blog page.
		* TODO WooCommerce checks are no longer blocking (performance... it means we should move "woocommerce" support to a compat file, and improve the API if necessary)
		* The main plugin's cache is now flushed after the SEO settings are requested to be updated, even when the options didn't change.
		* The automated scheme detection can now prevent the sitemap from using, and caching, the wrong scheme.
		* A lot of verbatim regarding various settings, to make it more clear what they do, and when they do it.
		* The sitemap and stylesheet URLs should no longer be shown in the search results of search engines.
		* Added a description on character counters, telling what happens when you click them.
		* All sitemap transients are now deleted on corresponding deletion queries when using WPML.
		* TODO We've scanned the plugin once more for performance culprits, and improved what needed improving.
		* The SEO Bar will no longer overflow, but it will now wrap automatically when needed.
		* Added a descriptive warning to the sitewide `nofollow` and `noarchive` settings.
	* **Changed:**
		* TSF now requires WordPress 4.6 (previously 4.4).
		* TSF now requires PHP 5.4 (previously 5.3).
		* URL input types (Canonical, Redirect) are now `url` instead of `text`. This means you need to supply a correct URL according to the browser, instead that only TSF checks for correctness after it's being saved.
		* Term title prefixes are now applied to Open Graph and Twitter titles too.
		* The [Schema.org effort states](https://schema.org/docs/faq.html#19) they're moving towards and are going to prefer HTTPS. So, after two years including some testing, we abide to be future-proof. Note that it's a parameter, not a link.
		* On post preview, the plugin no longer outputs SEO meta. This is to prevent object caching conflicts.
		* On post preview, the plugin no longer redirects. This is to prevent browser caching conflicts.
		* The sitemap's "generated by" mark now leads to our homepage, instead of the WordPress.org plugin page. The URL is still invisible and otherwise blocked from robots, and can be easily removed using the [Incognito extension](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/incognito/).
		* The "Home" URL in the plugin activation page is now dubbed "About".
	* **Updated:**
		* Most, if not all, database transients related to this plugin have been invalidated and are being rebuilt. The old transients will be cleaned up by WordPress automatically.
	* **Removed:**
		* Firefox post list table compatibility and fixes that account for the wide SEO Bar; they don't work anymore as intended, and they cause issues on other well-built browsers.
		* Counters now only work with JavaScript enabled. In PHP, this added too much overhead as we were predicting and counting in code.
		* Open Graph, Twitter, and SEO plugins no longer disables certain functionality in the plugin.
			* Instead, only a warning is shown on the settings page.
			* We made this change as some users found this plugin to be broken when trying it out, while it was actually preventing conflicts when other plugins remained active.
		* When a sitemap file or plugin is found, this plugin no longer removes its related settings.
			* Instead, only a warning is shown on the settings page, telling that the options have no effect.
		* AnsPress title compatibility, they handle this. TODO verify
		* --JETPACK JetPack Open Graph compatibility checks, they handle this since 2016.
		* TODO (maybe) Description and schema output caching. They cause too much overhead, and they provide no benefit any more. In fact, they affect performance negatively.
	* **Fixed:**
		* When reactivating or deactivating the plugin, there's no longer a chance for your SEO options to be wiped on a random database error.
			* We used to delete the options, so we could reactivate option-auto-loading; now we add a buster-timestamp.
		* Various RTL UI elements are now aligned correctly.
		* On Firefox, checkbox options marked "default" (recommended) or "warned" (use at own risk) are now color-coded again.
		* When adding a new category when no category is selected, the primary term is now correctly assigned.
		* When the primary term selection changed after load and when a new category is added, the previous category is no longer assigned as primary.
		* Twitter description and title fields now render escaped `<&'">` characters in placeholders correctly when fetched from related Open Graph fields.
		* TODO Date (and other?) archives now show valid Open Graph metadata. (description missing check... where's Facebook's "what's valid and when" schema..?)
		* When no description or title is found for the corresponding Open Graph or Twitter fields, no more infinite loop will occur that might crash the browser. Luckily, modern browsers detect this to prevent said crashes.
		* When the homepage is a blog, it'll now be included in the sitemap again.
		* Thanks to the upgrade to PHP 5.4, the SEO bar can now count words with non-latin special characters.
			* In their normal form of writing, it's not able to count han characters.
		* When no tagline is set in the WordPress settings, the home page will no longer display "Untitled on Site name" for the description by default.
		* Ultimate Member support:
			* The Canonical URL is now correct.
			* The Descriptions are now correct.
			* The Titles are now fully controlled by TSF.
			* Extranous meta output from Ultimate Member has been removed.
		* TODO BuddyPress canonical profile links are now supported.
		* Invalid settings' input are now checked before you can change tabs. This makes the saving buttons work as intended.
			* TODO consider checking closed postboxes too.... we could add an on-publish listener that checks if our postboxes are closed, and open them if they contain invalid values.
				* `jQuery( elem ).find( '.hndle, .handlediv' ).trigger( 'click.postboxes' );`

* **For translators:**
	* **New translations are available.**
	* **Notes:**
		* We no longer list every single linguistic change here. It's very tedious and slows down development time tremendously.
		* In this update, you'll find that languages that use grammatical gender can be more incisive.
		* All new translatable strings are available at the [translation page](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/autodescription).

* **For developers:**
	* **Tips:**
		* Want to check if TSF is activated? Use: `defined( 'THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_PRESENT' )`.
		* Want to use TSF's API? You're in (fail)safe hands with `the_seo_framework()`.
		* Want to make sure you can use TSF's API? Call `the_seo_framework()->loaded`.
	* **Added:**
		* Singleton class `\The_SEO_Framework\Builders\Scripts`, via a "Builder Pattern", callable as e.g. `the_seo_framework()->Scripts()::function_name()`.
			* This is the first class of this kind in The SEO Framework plugin.
		* The plugin now tries to remove all active `wp_title` filters, like it has been doing for `pre_get_document_title` a long time.
	* **Improved:**
		* A "doing it wrong" notice is now supplied when calling `the_seo_framework()` too early.
		* Fixed all "non-passive event listener" warnings caused by jQuery, by using our own event handlers.
		* The "doing it wrong" notice on "too early" query calls now shows the query-class method called.
	* **Changed:**
		* The title generation has been overhauled.
		* The plugin now loads within the `/bootstrap/` folder via the plugin's initial `autodescription.php` file, where you can more easily discern how the plugin's loaded.
		* [JavaScript]: Tooltips are now instanced via their own object named `window.tsfTT`, eliminating the previous JS API.
			* The auto-invoked API still works as intended, via CSS.
		* [JavaScript]: Media handlers are now instanced via their own object named `window.tsfMedia`, eliminating the previous JS API.
		* [JavaScript]: Primary Term handlers are now instanced via their own object named `window.tsfPT`, eliminating the previous JS API.
		* TODO Open Graph and Twitter meta rendering has been compressed into a single function, so we can apply conditions more easily.
	* **Removed:**
		* We removed the `seotips` folder and their contents. They were a gimmick, accumulating SEO tips brought over past plugin update changelogs.
		* Many deprecated methods, which were deprecated on or before TSF v2.9.4 (August 30, 2017).
		* The plugin's automagic-upgrader has been removed, which has been replaced with a static, ordered and semantic plugin upgrader since TSF v2.7.0.
		* Meta-generator methods' debugging have been removed, along with all the debugging methods used for that.
		* Title "doing it wrong" checks have been removed.
	* **Fixed:**
		* The wpForo title compatibility filter no longer emits a PHP notice when no title is generated from their plugin.
		* A highly unlikely PHP error now won't occur when `$wpdb` returns incomplete data on excluded archive/search IDs.
		* A PHP notice and unintentionally false-esque return value when the post ID is 0, or when the post ID is excluded, in method `is_post_included_in_sitemap()`.
		* A PHP warning is no longer omitted caused by a referencing parameter in `\The_SEO_Framework\_bbpress_filter_do_adjust_query()`.
	* **Class notes:**
		 * **Added:**
		 	* `\The_SEO_Framework\Silencer`, called when `\The_SEO_Framework\Load` is blocked from loading in filters.
	* **Constant notes:**
		* **Added:**
			* `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_PRESENT`, defined when the plugin gets past environmental tests.
			* `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_BOOTSTRAP_PATH`, holds the bootstrap folder's path.
			* `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_DIR_PATH_TRAIT`, holds the plugin traits' folder's path.
		* **Ignored:** _(no longer have an effect)_
			* `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_DEBUG_HIDDEN`
	* **Function notes:**
		* **Added:**
			* `the_seo_framework_boot()`, marked private (do not use).
			* `the_seo_framework_pre_boot_test()`, marked private.
			* `the_seo_framework_db_version()`, returns the site's TSF-database version.

			* `the_seo_framework_test_server()`, without deprecation--no one should've used this.
			* `the_seo_framework_load_base_files()`, without deprecation--no one should've used this. Use `the_seo_framework_boot()` instead (it's marked private, so you shouldn't).
			* `the_seo_framework_test_server_phase()`, without deprecation--no one should've used this.
			* `\The_SEO_Framework\_init()`, without deprecation--no one should've used this. Use `the_seo_framework()` instead.
			* `\The_SEO_Framework\_um_user_functions_available()`, without deprecation--it's an internal compatibility function.
			* `\The_SEO_Framework\_um_filter_custom_field_title()`, without deprecation--it's an internal compatibility function.
		* **Deprecated:**
			* `the_seo_framework_active()`. Use expression `the_seo_framework()->loaded` instead.
			* `the_seo_framework_version()`. Use constant `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_VERSION` instead.
			* `the_seo_framework_dot_version()`, without a replacement.
