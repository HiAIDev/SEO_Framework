= Unbranded, Free and for the Professional =
This plugin is unbranded! This means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within the WordPress interface, aside from the plugin activation page.
This plugin makes great use of the default WordPress interface elements, like as if this plugin is part of WordPress. No ads, no nags.
The small and hidden HTML comment can easily be disabled with the use of a filter or extension.

Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your or someone else's website. A clean interface, for everyone.

= Completely automated =
**By default, this plugin automatically generates:**

* Title, with super-fast 'wrong themes' support.
* Description, with anti-spam techniques.
* A canonical URL, with full WPMUdev Domain Mapping, subdomain and HTTPS support to prevent duplicated content.
* Various Open Graph, Facebook and Twitter tags.
* Special Open Graph description, which organically integrates with the Facebook and Twitter snippets.
* Extended Open Graph Images support, including automated image manipulation.
* Schema.org JSON-LD script that adds extended search support for Google Search and Chrome.
* Schema.org JSON-LD script for Knowledge Graph (Personal/Business site relations, name and logo).
* Advanced Schema.org JSON-LD script for Breadcrumbs (just like the visual one) which extends page relation support in Google Search.
* Schema.org JSON-LD script to show the correct site name in Google Breadcrumbs.
* Publishing and editing dates, accurate to the day.
* Link relationships, with full WPMUdev Domain Mapping and HTTPS support.
* Simple Sitemap with Pages, Posts and Custom Post Types (CPT), which listens to the in-post settings.
* Feed excerpts and backlinks to prevent content scraping.

**This plugin goes further, behind the screens it:**

* Prevents canonical errors with categories, pages, subdomains and Multisite Domain Mapping.
* Discourages 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even if they don't send a 404 response.
* Automatically notifies Google, Bing and Yandex on Post or Page update and deletion when sitemaps are enabled.

= Generously personal =
**This plugin allows you to manually set various values for each post, page, public CPT and term.**

**This plugin allows you to adjust over 90 site settings, including:**

* Title and Description Separators and additions.
* Automated description output.
* Schema.org output, including Knowledge Graph options.
* Various robots' options.
* Many home page specific options.
* Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest social integration
* Shortlink tag output.
* Link relationships
* Google, Bing, Pinterest and Yandex Webmaster verification
* Sitemap integration.
* Robots.txt sitemap integration.
* Feed anti-scraper options.
* And many, many more settings.

= Openly pluggable =
The SEO Framework has been built to go further than just itself.
Take a look at the API documentation located at [The SEO Framework API Docs](http://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= The SEO Bar =
**This plugin helps you to create better content, at a glance. By showing you:**

* If the title is too long, too short, duplicated, and/or automatically generated.
* If the description is too long, too short, duplicated, has too many repeated words and/or automatically generated.
* If the page is indexed, redirected, followed and/or archived, while looking at other WordPress settings.

**We call this The SEO Bar. Check out the [Screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/screenshots/#plugin-info) to see how it helps you!**

= Hardcore caching =
This plugin's code is highly optimized on PHP-level and uses variable, object and transient caching. This means that there's little extra page load time from this plugin, even with more Meta tags used.
A caching plugin isn't even needed for this plugin as you won't notice a difference, however it's supported wherever best suited.

= Compatibility =

* Full internationalization support through WordPress.org.
* Extended Multibyte support (CJK).
* Full Right to Left (RTL) language support.
* Extended Color vision deficiency accessibility.
* Screen reader accessibility.
* MultiSite, this plugin is in fact built upon one.
* Detection of robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.
* Detection of theme Title output "doing it right" (or wrong).
* Automatic detection of various other popular SEO tools.

**If you have other popular SEO plugins activated, this plugin will automatically prevent SEO mistakes by deactivating itself on almost every part.**

= An additional sitemap =
The Sitemap generated with The SEO Framework is sufficient for Search Engines to find Posts, Pages and supported Custom Post Types throughout your website.
It also listens to the noindex settings on each of the items.
If you however require a more expanded Sitemap, feel free to activate a dedicated Sitemap plugin. The SEO Framework will automatically deactivate its Sitemap functionality when another (known) Sitemap plugin is found.
If it is not automatically detected and no notification has been provided on the Sitemap Settings, feel free to open a support ticket and it will be addressed carefully.

= Hidden breadcrumbs =
The Breadcrumb script generated by this plugin on Posts will also make sure Google easily finds related categories which aren't included within the Sitemap of this plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Install The SEO Framework either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.
1. Either Network Activate this plugin or activate it on a single site.
1. That's it!
1. Let the plugin automatically work or fine-tune each page with the metaboxes beneath the content or on the taxonomy pages.
1. Adjust the SEO settings through the SEO settings page if desired. Red checkboxes are rather left unchecked. Green checkboxes are default enabled.

== Screenshots ==

1. This plugin shows you what you can improve, at a glance. With full color vision deficiency support.
2. Hover over any of the SEO Bar's items to see how you can improve the page's SEO. Red is bad, orange is okay, green is good. Blue is situational.
3. The dynamic Post/Page SEO settings Metabox. This box is also neatly implemented in Categories and Tags.
4. The SEO Settings Page. With over 90 settings, you are in full control. Using the Default Settings and filling in the Knowledge Graph Settings and Social Meta Settings is recommended to do.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework Free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads or nags!

= Is there a premium version? =

Nope! This plugin is all-inclusive.

= Free & Premium Extensions =

For more advanced SEO options and output, we offer the free plugin [Extension Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-extension-manager/).

= I have a feature request, I've found a bug, a plugin is incompatible... =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell me about it. I try to get back to you within 48 hours. :)

= Is this really a Framework? =

This plugin is not in particular a framework in a technical sense, but it is built with a framework's mindset. It is however a framework for your website's SEO, a building block that keeps everything together.
This means that this plugin will do all the great Search Engine Optimization, and also allows for extensions and real-time alterations. For when you really want or need to change something.
Extensions built for this plugin might just as well work as a standalone. The SEO Framework provides an easier and cached way of doing so, however.

= I am a developer; how can I help? =

The SEO Framework is currently a one-man project. However, any input is greatly appreciated and everything will be considered.
Please visit the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework) to submit issues or even pull requests.

= I want to remove or change stuff, but I can't find an option! =

The SEO Framework is very pluggable on many fields. Please refer to the [Other Notes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/other_notes/).
Please note that a free plugin is underway which will allow you to change all scalar filters from the dashboard. No ETA yet.

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, news, etc. is this OK? =

This is not an issue. Search Engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.
If a visitor can't find a page, then why would a Search Engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's usability.

= What's does the application/ld+json script do? =

The JSON-LD scripts are Search Engine helpers which tell Search Engines how to connect and index the site.
They can tell the Search Engine if your site contains an internal search engine, what sites you're socially connected to and what page structure you're using.
This is also refered to as Structured Data.

= The meta data is not being updated, and I'm using a caching plugin. =

All The SEO Framework's metadata is put into Object cache when a caching plugin is available. The descriptions and Schema.org scripts are put into Transients. Please be sure to clear your cache.

= I want to transport SEO data from other plugins to The SEO Framework, how do I do this? =

Please refer to this small guide: [SEO Data Migration](http://theseoframework.com/docs/seo-data-migration/).
Transporting Terms and Taxonomies SEO data isn't supported.

== Changelog ==

= 2.9.0 - Equitable Erudition =

*Courage is found in unlikely places - J.R.R. Tolkien*

**Release date:**
/ TODO

**Summarized:**
/ TODO

**For everyone: Tabbed In-post SEO layout**
/
* This release brings tabbed layout to the in-post SEO settings.
* With this change I've also altered the overal looks, with the help from [Daniel](https://github.com/danielpost).
* This layout allows extensions from the [Extension Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-extension-manager/) to be implemented much easier.
* This layout is self-responsive! This means it's not dependent on the browser-size, but on how much content will fit.
* This layout therefore allows the SEO settings to be placed in the right sidebar! Take a look at the [new screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/screenshots/).
TODO Add screenshots and link to it.

**For everyone: Browser support**
/
* This release brings [CSS Flexbox](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/) to the new in-post SEO settings metabox.
* The flexbox module is still experimental, in a way that not all browsers correctly support this to the fullest extend.
* However, support for as many browsers feasible has been implemented. Check out [the list](https://theseoframework.com/?p= TODO #browser-support). Enjoy!
* The gist is that Chrome, Firefox, IE10 and Safari 6 or later are supported.

**Detailed log:**
/
***It is some miles, but [it will shorten your journey tomorrow](https://theseoframework.com/?p= TODO #detailed).***

/ TODO move this to detailed with notice. id browser-support

		* Edge 14
		* Edge 13
		* Edge 12 or lower unconfirmed
	* Safari:

* **Confirmed not to work:**
	* IE9 or lower
	* iOS 6 or lower
	* Safari 5 or lower

* **For everyone:**
	* **Added:**
		* The inpost SEO settings are now devided in tabs.
			* This allows me to add more options in the near future, either through this plugin or even extensions.
			* Stay tuned on its enhanced implementation!
		* [Schema.org sitename](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/sitename) `alternateName` output.
			* This name is now also considered by Google.
			* This name is only set if the Organization or Personal Name option is filled in and when it's not idential to the site name.
		* The home page has a new tab: Social Settings.
			* In which you can set your favorite social image.
			* This image is used on Open Graph, Twitter and Schema metadata.
	* **Improved:**
		* Post overview SEO Bar data rendering is a lot lighter now.
		* Breadcrumbs have been improved:
		 	1. Breadcrumb images are no longer output when there's none present in the crumb.
				* Breadcrumbs' cache isn't invalidated, because this wasn't incorrect nor does it change the behavior; the output is just cleaner.
				* Its presence used to be required (a few months ago), this is no longer the case.
				* As stated various times: Schema.org usage is under heavy development and I'm trying my best to keep up.
			2. Breadcrumbs no longer use fallback images, only set page/post images.
				* Breadcrumbs' cache isn't invalidated, because this doesn't change the current usage behavior.
			3. Parent pages' breadcrumbs now output social image, when applicable.
			4. The Blogpage-as-Homepage can now output a breadcrumb image, because you can now set an image in the homepage settings.
		* Navigational tabs in on the SEO settings page now quickly fade, rather than "instantly" change.
			* This subtly initiates a guided focus and hints you subconciously to what has changed. Yes, TSF invades your mind.
		* When you use browser navigation (go back/forward), the navigational tabs are now corresponding to the previous selection.
			* Yes, this is glitchy because browsers are slow, but it's not common for this to happen.
			* No, this can't work on the new In-post tabs. Because WordPress resets all radio buttons on navigation.
		* The "homepage as blog" page can now be included in the sitemap, when present.
		* When the homepage is a blog, and a new post has been posted; the sitemap lastmod entry now also updates for it.
		* The blogpage now outputs the lastmod date as either the latest post entry, or the latest blog page update; whichever was most recent.
	* **Changed:**
		* Redesigned In-Post SEO Settings layout. Thank you [Daniel](https://github.com/danielpost)!
		* A source link is no longer generated on feed entries without content.
		* The social image selection buttons have been moved below the bound text input.
		* Contributors (capability: `edit_posts`) can now select their own counter type, rather than only Authors (capability: `publish_posts`) and above.
	* **Removed:**
		* Twitter `photo` card. This has been deprecated and has been replaced with `summary_large_image`.
			* All related options and outputs have been updated.
			* When updating the plugin the upgrade handler will scan for the photo card option, and will change it to `summar_large_image` if it's `photo`.
	* **Fixed:**
		* Authors (capability: `upload_files`) and above can now crop social images, rather than only Administrators (capability: `customize`) and above.
		* The terms and taxonomies SEO bar now correctly display the robots values again.
		* When emptying the Home Page Custom title, the Additions are now correctly updated once again.
		* The feed excerpt generation and original content link generation work again.
			* The call was misplaced. Sorry about that!
		* When emptying the floating title (while it's being on the right), the placeholder no longer jumps or animates.
		* When the Home Page Settings metabox is closed on load, the dynamic placeholder is now no longer stacked when opened.
		* When you switch between other tabs and the General tab in the Home Page Settings metabox, the "are you sure you want to leave" is no longer triggered by accident.
		* When the Inpost SEO Settings metabox is closed on load, the dynamic placeholder is now no longer stacked when opened.
		* When moving your mouse up fast over The SEO Bar, some tooltips could've possibly hung.
		* When on mobile, when you tap on a second or later SEO Bar while the first bar was hidden from visibility, the arrow could've been moved off-tap when the first entry was closed.
		* RTL: When Title additions have been set to "Right", the indentation of the title no longer shifts all the way to the left.
		* RTL: The Dynamic Title for the home page was reversed.
		* bbPress topic tags now (mostly) output the correct data.
		* Some options were incorrectly set to default upon plugin update.
			* This has been handled correctly, so you won't notice anything from this bug upon upgrade.
		* With WPMUdev Domain Mapping, when no scheme has been preferred in mapping selection, the SEO settings preferred scheme now kicks in.
		* The preferred URL scheme selection now works, rather than always detecting it automatically. Sorry for that!
		* Social Image selection labels now correctly focus on the input field when clicked.
		* 301 redirect labels now correctly focus on the input field when clicked.
		* The floating title placeholder's offset is now perfectly calculated and no longer uses the padding of the input box, but an actual typographic space instead.
		* The floating title placeholder is now also correctly recalculated on resize.
		* The sitemap location URLs are now correct on subdirectory installations.
			* This now makes pinging of the sitemap work on those installations too.
		* The robots.txt file isn't generated on subdirectory installations. This is intended, and the link has now been omitted from the settings.
		* The homepage noindex option is now also considered for its sitemap entry addition.

* **For translators:**
	* **Updated:**
		/
		* TODO POT translation file.
			* Translations are handled through [WordPress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/autodescription).
	* **Changed:**
		* "Adding a backlink below the feed's content will also let the visitors know where the content came from."
			* Now is: "Adding a backlink below the feed entries will also let the visitors know where the content came from."
			* Clarity: A feed is a list, a feed entry is a part.
		* "Convert feed content into excerpts?"
			* Now is: "Convert feed entries into excerpts?"
			* Clarity: A feed is a list, a feed entry is a part.
		* "Add backlinks below the feed content?"
			* Now is: "Add link to source below the feed content?"
			* Vague: Backlinks are an SEO term (which the option doesn't affect), rather than a litterally implied thing (which it actually is).
		* "The shortlink tag might have some use for 3rd party service discoverability, but it has little to no SEO value whatsoever."
			* Now is: "The shortlink tag can be manually used for microblogging services like Twitter, but it has no SEO value whatsoever."
			* Vague: Even I couldn't explain it. Also, no prominently known services use the tag (anymore).
			* Altered: Added the word "manually", because you're better off manually copying it from the source code for shortening the URL; e.g. for Twitter.
			* Altered: "little to no" now is "no", because it really has no SEO value.
		* "A social image can be displayed when your website is shared. They are a great way to grab attention."
			* Now is: "A social image can be displayed when your website is shared. It is a great way to grab attention.""
			* Grammar: It's one image.
		* "Start The Seo Framework" / "End The Seo Framework"
			* Now is: "Start The SEO Framework" and "End The SEO Framework".
			* Typo: "Seo" should've been SEO.
		* "Another robots.txt sitemap location addition has been detected."
			* Now is: Another robots.txt sitemap Location addition has been detected.
			* Ugly capitalization: I tend to add capitalization on words that carry the most important subject at hand. This should be done differently in the future.
			* More of these fixes will take place in the future.

* **For developers:**
	* **Added:**
		* (JavaScript) A triggered event after The SEO Framework's jQuery code has been initiatlized on `document.body`: `tsf-ready`.
		* (JavaScript) A triggered event after an SEO settings tab has been toggled and when the content is visible (i.e. `display:block;`) on the tab's radio button: `tsf-tab-toggled`.
		* (JavaScript) A triggered event after an inpost SEO settings tab has been toggled and when the content is visible (i.e. `display:flex;`) on the tab's radio button: `tsf-flex-tab-toggled`.
		* (JavaScript) A triggered event that runs on any call that can affect the flexbox' size, like window resize, or admin menu collapse: `tsf-flex-resize`. Only runs when tsf-flex is found.
		* (JavaScript) A new object parameter: `nonces`, this replaces `nonce` (which still exists) and can be easily expanded in the future for enhanced security. A few defaults are automatically set for currently used roles.
		* Method `do_redirect()`. Only use this on action `template_redirect`.
		* Method `update_option`, allows for easily updating single SEO options. Use `update_settings` if you wish to update multiple option values at once.
		* Method `delete_object_cache`, allows for easily deleting The SEO Framework object cache.
			* This has been disabled for now. See [issue 104](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework/issues/104).
		* Method `get_image()` now has a new argument for the second parameter: `skip_fallback`. Useful in some scenarios.
	* **Improved:**
		* (JavaScript) `tsf.dynamicPlaceholderOnLoad` has been removed and is no longer called. It caused a duplicated method call.
			* It has been removed from the protected externs file too.
		* A doing it wrong notice is now displayed when a query-capable method is called too early, which is therefore error-prone.
			* All internal methods that did it wrong have been adjusted accordingly.
			* This is mainly added for internal debugging purposes, but might eliminate external plugin errors.
	* **Removed:**
		* Method `init_feed()`, it's now `_init_feed_output()` and is now marked private.
		* Method `custom_field_redirect()`, it's now `_init_custom_field_redirect()` and is now marked private.
		* Deprecation handler of method `reparse_image_args()`, introduced in 2.5.0
	* **Changed:**
		* Method `delete_main_cache()` now flushes SEO Meta object cache too.
			* This has been disabled for now. See [issue 104](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework/issues/104).
		* Method `get_warned_site_options()` no longer returns non-warned settings keys. This reduces plugin memory usage.
		* Method `get_image()` parameters have been changed.
			* First parameter is now used for arguments.
			* Second parameter is now deprecated.
			* Backwards compatibility has been put in placed with a doing_it_wrong notice.
			* Warning: Method has been deprecated.
		* Method `get_social_image_url_from_post_meta()`
		 	1. It no longer checks for fallback page ID.
		 	2. The first parameter is now required.
		* Method `get_image_from_post_thumbnail()` no longer checks for fallback page ID.
		* Method `parse_og_image()` now has a third parameter: `$set_og_dimensions`, whether to set OG image dimensions for output, default `false`.
	* **Deprecated:**
		* Method `get_image()`, use `get_social_image()` instead.
		* Method `get_image_from_post_thumbnail()`, use `get_social_image_from_post_thumbnail()` instead.
		* Method `is_front_page()`, use `is_real_front_page()` instead.
			* **Warning**: The input parameter has been removed. It will check **only for the current page**.
			* **Alternative**: Use the new method `is_front_page_by_id()` if you wish to check **only for the input ID**.
			* This change has been introduced because the query would otherwise always return true on the frontpage. This way it's split.
			* More of these query changes will be introduced in the future.
	* **Fixed:**
		* Method `the_seo_framework()->get_social_image_url_from_post_meta()` second parameter now works.
		* Method `the_seo_framework()->convert_markdown()` had some fixes implemented:
			* Header markdown now works (h1 to h6).
			* Numeric values `2` now no longer stops strong from working.
			* Numeric values `1` now no longer stops emphasis from working.
			* Numeric values `1` now no longer stops code from working.
	* **Filter Notes:**
		* **Added:**
			* `(bool) the_seo_framework_use_breadcrumb_seo_title`, determines whether to use custom SEO titles or WordPress set only.
			* `(string) the_seo_framework_custom_field_description`, alters the Description from custom field.
			* `(string) the_seo_framework_generated_description`, alters the generated Description.
			* `(string) the_seo_framework_fetched_description_excerpt`, alters the excerpt to use for generating a description.
			* `(int) the_seo_framework_current_admin_id`, allows changing of the admin query ID.
			* `(array) the_seo_framework_available_twitter_cards`, lists the available Twitter cards. Not index sensitive.
			* `(string) the_seo_framework_metabox_context`, alters the metabox screen context.
			* `(array) the_seo_framework_inpost_settings_tabs`, allows for inpost metabox manipulation.
		* **Changed:**
			* `(bool|string) the_seo_framework_inpost_seo_bar` no longer has effect on Singular post types.
