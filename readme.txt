= Unbranded, Free and for the Professional =
This plugin is unbranded! This means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within the WordPress interface, aside from the plugin activation page. This plugin makes great use of the default WordPress interface elements, like as if this plugin is part of WordPress. No ads, no nags. The small and hidden HTML comments can easily be disabled with the use of a filter or extension.

Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your or someone else's website. A clean interface, for everyone.

= Completely automated =
**By default, this plugin automatically generates:**

* Titles according to your settings with archive prefixes.
* Descriptions with anti-spam techniques and detection that informs you when it can be improved.
* A canonical URL to prevent duplicated content; with full "domain mapping", subdomain, and HTTPS support.
* Various Open Graph, Facebook and Twitter tags.
* Special Open Graph descriptions, which organically integrates within the Facebook and Twitter snippets.
* Open Graph images, they are automatically resized and optimized when needed.
* Structured Data for Google Search and Chromium that adds extended on-site search support.
* Structured Data for Google's Knowledge Graph; like Personal/Business site relations, names, and logos.
* Structured Data for Breadcrumbs that extend pages and categories relationship support in Google Search.
* Structured Data for Google Search that lets it know your preferred site name.
* Publishing and editing dates for social sites and search engines alike.
* Paginated content relationship links, to help visitors going to the right page.
* A sitemap with all your pages, posts and CPT, which listens to their page settings.
* Feed excerpts and backlinks within, to reduce automated content theft.

**This plugin goes further, behind the screens it:**

* Prevents canonical errors with categories, pages, subdomains and Multisite Domain Mapping.
* Discourages 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even if they don't send a 404 response.
* Automatically notifies Google, Bing, and Yandex on website updates when sitemaps are enabled.

= Generously personal =
**This plugin allows you to manually set various values for each post, page, public CPT, and term.**

**This plugin allows you to adjust over 100 site settings, including:**

* Automated title output options; they encourage you to follow the guidelines.
* Automated description output options.
* Schema.org structured data output options.
* Various robots meta output options.
* Many home page specific options.
* Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest social integration options.
* Google, Bing, Pinterest and Yandex webmaster verification codes.
* Sitemap integration with personalization.
* Robots.txt sitemap integration.
* Feed anti-scraper options.
* And many, many more settings.

= Openly pluggable =
The SEO Framework has been built to go further than just itself.
Take a look at the API documentation located at [The SEO Framework API Docs](http://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= The SEO Bar =
**This plugin helps you to create better content, at a glance. By showing you:**

* If the title is too long, too short, duplicated, and/or automatically generated.
* If the description is too long, too short, duplicated, has too many repeated words and/or automatically generated.
* If the page is indexed, redirected, followed and/or archived, while looking at other WordPress settings.

**We call this the SEO Bar. Check out the [Screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/#screenshots) to see how it helps you!**

= Hardcore caching =
This plugin's code is highly optimized on PHP-level and uses variable, object and transient caching. This means that there's little extra page load time from this plugin, even with more meta tags used.

A caching plugin isn't even needed for this plugin as you won't notice a difference; however, it's supported wherever best suited.

= Compatibility =
**This plugin supports:**

* PHP 5.4 and higher.
* WordPress 4.6 and higher.
* Internationalization through WordPress.org.
* Multibyte calculation and rendering, including Emoji and CJK.
* Right to Left (RTL) languages, through its interface and generation.
* Extended color vision deficiency accessibility.
* Screen reader accessibility.
* Multisite, this plugin is in fact built upon one.
* Detection of robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.
* Both up-to-date and outdated themes.
* Detection of various other popular SEO tools to prevent duplicated output.
* Translation plugins like WPML, Polylang, WPGlobus and MultilingualPress.
* WooCommerce, for free, in all its glory.

= An additional sitemap =
The sitemap generated with The SEO Framework is sufficient for search engines to find posts, pages and supported custom post types throughout your website. It also listens to the "noindex" settings on each of the items and works great with various translation plugins.

However, if you require a more expanded sitemap, feel free to activate a dedicated Sitemap plugin. The SEO Framework will automatically deactivate its Sitemap functionality when another (known) sitemap plugin is found. If it is not automatically detected and no notification has been provided in the Sitemap Settings, feel free to open a support ticket and it will be addressed carefully.

= Hidden breadcrumbs =
The Breadcrumb script generated by this plugin on Posts will also make sure Google easily finds related categories which aren't included in the Sitemap of this plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework Free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads or nags!
This plugin is all-inclusive without upsells.

= Is there more? =

For more advanced SEO options and output, we offer the free plugin [Extension Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-extension-manager/).

= I have a feature request, I've found a bug, a plugin is incompatible... =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell us about it.
We'll try to get back to you within 72 hours. :)

= I am a developer; how can I help? =

Any input is greatly appreciated, and everything will be considered.
Please visit the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework) to submit issues or even pull requests.

= I want to modify how this plugin works. =

The SEO Framework is very pluggable in many fields. Please refer to the [API documentation](https://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, news, etc. is this OK? =

This is not an issue. Search engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.
If a visitor can't find a page, then why would a search engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's usability.

Check out our [Extension Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-extension-manager/).
It contains extensions, like Articles, that fill in the gaps with newer techniques.

= The sitemap contains unwanted links. =

The SEO Framework takes all publicly queryable posts, pages, and CPT and puts them in the sitemap.

If you don't want a page in the sitemap, consider enabling the `noindex` option. This will also remove the page from search engine result pages.

If the link shouldn't be in the sitemap because it's meant for structural reasons, then inform the plugin or theme author that created them.
You should tell the author to check out the "`public` and `rewrite` post type arguments". The plugin or theme author should know that that means.

= What's do the application/ld+json scripts do? =

The JSON-LD scripts are search engine helpers which tell search engines how to connect and index the site.
They can tell the search engine if your site contains an internal search engine, what sites you're socially connected to and what page structure you're using.
This is also referred to as "Structured Data".

= The metadata is not being updated, and I'm using a caching plugin. =

All The SEO Framework's metadata is put into Object cache when a caching plugin is available.
The descriptions and Schema.org scripts are put into Transients.
Please be sure to clear your cache or adjust the plugin's caching settings if deemed necessary.

= I want to transport SEO data from other plugins to The SEO Framework, how do I do this? =

Please refer to this small guide: [SEO Data Migration](http://theseoframework.com/docs/seo-data-migration/).
Transporting Categories, Tags and other terms' SEO data isn't supported.

== Changelog ==

= 3.1.0 - TODO =

**Release date**

* August TODOth, 2018

NOTE: ref: https://theseoframework.com/?p=1792

1. PHP 5.3 support has been dropped. Here's why:
	* TODO
	* This lowers maintenance and workaround cost, and it increases our productivity; so, we can focus on faster, better, and more intelligent solutions.
	* For more information, see: https://wordpress.org/support/upgrade-php/
2. WP 4.4 and 4.5 support has been dropped. Here's why:
	* TODO
	* Consistent admin screen and post type detection, so you won't find bugs anymore stemming from backward compatibility.
	* Newer and reliable functionality, like upgrading memory availability.
	* This lowers maintenance and support cost, so we can focus on giving you a better product.
	* For more information, see: https://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress

**Feature highlights:**

* TODO

**Summarized:**

* Like previous updates, this update...
* TODO
* Attachment Pages are now known as "Media".

TODO note about that some options have been relocated.

**For everyone: Better and faster titles**

* Over the years, the title generation code became bigger, unsustainable, and eventually unmaintainable. So, it's now rewritten to almost half its previous size, being more straightforward and logical, without sacrificing any important features. In fact, we've added new features.
* With this rewrite, we're embracing what WordPress has to offer in its title translations and API hooks. So, you can expect much greater compatibility with other plugins and your favorite language.
* Having conditional additions to the title was the most requested feature, and that's now also available.
* TODO notify that the title detection is removed, and the user might find title fix useful. TODO consider title fix integration?
* For developers, note that this change heavily affects the title generation API. Although this change deems API adjustments less necessary, if you've used title functions or filters within this plugin and still need them, then go see the detailed log for needed adjustments. TODO make write-up, consider old features.

**For everyone: Better and faster descriptions**

* TODO See titles... same story.

**For everyone: Plugin conflict resolution**

* The SEO Framework no longer disables parts of its meta output, settings and other functionality when a conflicting plugin is found.
* Now, only red warnings are shown throughout the settings page.
* Most users aren't affected by this. However, if you think you're using any of [these plugins](TODO), you might wish to revise your settings.
* We made this change because it was confusing to many users; the plugin even seemed broken.

**For everyone: API changes**

* The plugin's API has been greatly overhauled and improved.
* If you have no coding experience, but have still implemented filters/snippets acquired from the support forums, please check out the debug logs.
* If you're getting deprecation or "doing it wrong" notices on the website or logs after updating, don't be alarmed. Copy the error or notice and paste it in our support forums in a code block. Our support team (Sybre...) will forge new snippets for you, or point you to newly available options.
* Note that you should never set `WP_DEBUG` to `true` (in `wp-config.php`) on a production website. Set this to `false`, live sites shouldn't be actively debugged.

**For developers: About the integral options**

* The integral options (from checkboxes and number fields) now always return a integral type, instead of a string.
* So, you'll now get a `(int) 0`, instead of a `(string) '0'`.
* This change was made because we now use `stripslashes_deep()`, which uses `stripslashes_from_strings_only()`.
* This improves performance. And, this shouldn't affect code behavior, unless you used strict integral-string checks.

**For developers: About the API**

* We've removed or otherwise deprecated most API functions. We've done this to lower maintenance time drastically.
* We encourage you to always use the factory function `the_seo_framework()`. Via this factory function, you can access all API methods when needed.
* The factory function yields many failsafe capturers so we can make future changes with peace of mind. This isn't possible with PHP functions.
* As more than three quarters the plugin's code is dormant on most pages, in future major releases we're going to cut off the "façade" class loading (where everything's accessible via `$this`), and split them into interfacing factories, e.g.: `the_seo_framework()->generate( 'url' )::set( 'id', 1 )::get( 'relative' )`. More on this will follow for 3.2 or later after a class-map draft is set up. Or goal is to minimize performance overhead; aiming to improve it further. TODO revise this.

**For developers: JavaScript changes:**

* The original JS file (stemming from August 2015) was a God Object container, which grew over 3000 lines of code. So, we split the code over multiple objects, thus files, to improve maintainability and added a script loader.
* Theoretically, we could've auto-combined the files in the loader (like WP `load-scripts.php` does), but we figured most servers use HTTP/2 now. And, if they don't, they should.
* With this introduction, most of the split-off code's API has been dropped, without deprecation. We plan to incorporate the new API into the Extension Manager, which now maintains its own versions of almost everything.
* We've also removed the externs files, as we long moved to favor Babel, instead of Closure Compiler.

## Detailed log

*Fred Brooks' law: "What one developer can do in one month, two developers can do in two months."*

TODO: Update POT file.

* **For everyone:**
	* **Added:**
		* New title options, including:
			* A toggle that strips HTML tags, like WordPress normally does.
			* On every singular page edit screen, a "Remove the blogname" toggle has been added.
		* New description options, including:
			* A toggle for automated descriptions.
		* New home page options, including:
			* Open Graph title.
			* Open Graph description.
			* Twitter Title.
			* Twitter description.
		* New robots options that allow setting robots for each post type.
			* These robots settings are applied to the whole custom post type, including its terms.
			* The "noindex" settings also remove the post type from the sitemap.
		* New SEO Bar checks:
			* When the generated description is empty, it'll now tell you with a blue block, instead of saying it's "far too short".
			* When the generated title is empty thanks to filters, it'll now tell you with a blue block, instead of saying it's "far too short".
			* Pages in draft correctly state their indexing status.
			* Pages that are protected now correctly state their indexing status.
			* When the Blog Page is empty, and when it's not the home page, it'll show a "noindex" notification.
			* Post types that have robots settings applied, now show them via appropriate notifications.
		* New post type settings:
			* Found in the General Settings meta box, they'll prevent The SEO Framework from interacting.
			* These settings should only be used on conflicting post types, like which offer their own SEO settings, or are otherwise incorrectly registered.
		* New sitemap settings:
			* Set the maximum posts queried per type.
			* Toggle the output of priorities. This is enabled by default for old sites, disabled for new sites.
		* The sitemap stylesheet now outputs favicon meta tags.
		* When you activate any plugin, a check will be performed for conflicting SEO plugins; when found, a single dismissible warning notification will be outputted.
			* Only users with plugin activation capabilities can see this message.
		* Breadcrumbs are now rendered on non-hierarchival pages, too.
		* The post-edit and global SEO settings' tabs now support keyboard navigation. You'll notice they'll have an accessible border around them when using keyboard navigation.
		* Polylang string translation support on titles and descriptions.
	* **Improved:**
		* The plugin can now downgrade its database version to the currently installed version automatically. This makes sure necessary future upgrade procedures are reinstated when you choose to downgrade (for any reason).
			* Since TSF v3.0.6 this happens when a user saved the options, but this could lead to inconsistent behavior on WordPress Multisite installations.
		* We removed a lot of redundant code (like option upgrade checks), which have long been superseded by better standards.
		* We've added descriptive links to all meta title and description labels.
		* Code and URL input types (Twitter profile, Webmasters' verification codes) now always flow from left to right, even if your site's written language setting is otherwise.
		* Tooltip arrows now always follow your mouse, for a more natural look.
		* Tooltips now support RTL screens without the arrow overflowing.
		* Tooltip arrows are now indented twice the size of a small object, like with `[?]`, giving them a more prominent look.
		* Canonical, redirect, and image URLs are no longer uselessly suggested by the browser for the administrative input fields.
		* The Facebook Business page URL description has been updated, to be in line with the current behavior.
		* The main plugin's cache is now flushed after the SEO settings are requested to be updated, even when the options aren't changed.
		* The automated scheme detection can now prevent the sitemap from using, and caching, the wrong scheme.
		* A lot of verbatim regarding various settings, to make it more clear what they do, and when they do it.
		* The sitemap and stylesheet URLs should no longer be shown in the search results of search engines.
		* Added a description on character counters, telling what happens when you click them.
		* All sitemap transients are now deleted on corresponding deletion queries when using WPML.
		* We've scanned the plugin once more for performance culprits, and improved what needed improving.
		* The SEO Bar will no longer overflow, but it will now wrap automatically when needed. For this, we had to change a few things.
			1. The tooltips aren't "boxed in" anymore, but flow wherever they deem best.
			2. There are 5 to 6 times as many tooltip listeners per SEO bar, as it did prior v3.0. TODO test performance and responsiveness // lighthouse?
				* TODO SEE: https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework/issues/18
				* Download more RAM instead? It's well established that browsers eat RAM for breakfast, especially since Spectre.
		* The SEO Bar is a little less daunting--by 13.63% in width to be exact.
		* The SEO Bar no longer performs intricate and slow requests to verify if we're on a term page on Custom Post Types list tables.
		* The SEO Bar is now capable of articulating post type names, instead of only term names.
		* The SEO Bar now suggests what you need to do with titles and descriptions that are deemed to short or long, instead of stating binary information.
		* On Firefox, list table overflow is now less prone to happen. We've removed compatibility fixes, and introduced a flexible system via CSS.
			* The overflowing is caused by a bug in Internet Explorer 6, which Firefox happily integrated, affecting roughly 30% of their users.
			* In short, [Gecko ignores word-wrap values in tables](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=587438), and for [13 years running](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=307866), Firefox ignores overflow-preventing width values. Both these bugs combined cause mayhem.
		* In the robots settings meta box, we've added a descriptive warning for the sitewide `nofollow` and `noarchive` settings.
		* In the homepage settings meta box, and on the post-edit metabox for the homepage, we've added a descriptive warning for the `nofollow` and `noarchive` settings.
		* The primary term selector tooltip now states the human readible and translatable (archive type) name, instead of the static code name.
		* WC Shop and Blog Pages now have "rel=prev/next" canonical URLs added when link relationship tags are enabled for archives.
		* WC Shop and Blog Pages now listen to the global pagination robots' "noindex" settings.
		* Long URLs are now truncated in the sitemap stylesheet. This does not affect the sitemap itself, nor how search engines see the URLs.
		* "Plausibly" embeddable URLs are now removed from the autogenerated descriptions. "Plausibly" because we don't extensively test the URLs for embeddability.
		* Plugin conflict notices are now shown in red.
		* Home page setting notifications are now always showing when applicable.
		* This plugin now detects Elementor as a conflicting plugin for content. This means that when Elementor builds a page, no automated description can be generated from the content.
		* The post-edit counters are no longer affected by your input when a preceding value is set in the Home Page SEO Settings.
		* The administrative title placeholders now better resemble the real front-end output when using HTML tokens or duplicated spaces.
		*  Webmasters' code input now automatically stripts extraneous HTML. So, you can simply paste the code you copied from the analytical setup interfaces.
		* The upgrade routine is now more intelligent, and is now able to skip upgrades that aren't necessary for new installations.
		* The upgrade routine can no longer happen on the SEO Settings page; instead, it redirects you from it to prevent setting desynchronization.
		* The upgrade routine automatically registers the default site options for new sites, so the admin interface no longer needs to be accessed (once) for them to have effect.
			* This is great for multisite setups that block the admin interface.
			* It prevents/resolves all sorts of first-run bugs, like the sitemap's initial registration.
		* When Polylang is active, users are now notified that it's better not to utilize some of the Home Page SEO settings metabox fields.
		* The settings handler has been slightly refactored to improve performance.
		* Shortlinks now support search.
		* Shortlinks now output shorter date-archive links.
		* New Google ListItem requirements have been put in place for the breadcrumbs.
		* The character counters can now count down to zero, and will notify you off it.
		* The pixel counter is now color coded. Hover over it to know why!
		* Switching SEO metabox tabs or loading a page with character counters is now a tad less resource intensive.
		* The Google Search Console' verification code link now directly sends you to the correct form.
		* Improved multibyte support in automated descriptions, like for finding punctiations.
		* Automated descriptions now try to find complete sentences by stripping the last three trailing words after the latest found punctuation mark.
	* **Changed:**
		* TSF now requires WordPress 4.6 (previously 4.4).
		* TSF now requires PHP 5.4 (previously 5.3).
		* The pixel and character-count guidelines have been updated:
			1. They're much more reluctant regarding description lengths.
			2. They're a little more reluctant regarding title lengths.
			3. The "is there a timestamp shown is search" condition has been removed, the effect hold no evidence anymore.
			4. They're more informative on Facebook and Twitter inputs.
		* The upgrader can now run on the front-end, to prevent missing options (which could harm your site in ranking). This means, that when you have auto-plugin-update enabled, or left the admin dashboard before an update finished, or updated via a multisite network interface:
			1. Some parts of the upgrade process doesn't run, like showing notifications of option changes. We will solve this in a later update, by enqueuing notifications.
			2. If your site runs out of memory on the front-end, the upgrade process might cause a white screen. This is highly unlikely, and will resolve itself, because the upgrader keeps record of how far it's gotten. We will solve this in a later update by adding memory exhaustion checks.
		* Upgrading from The SEO Framework 2.6.x or earlier is no longer reliable (a soft check was put in place), and we urge the ~100 webmasters still using it to reset and reconfigure their settings after updating. The upgrader was introduced in 2.7.0, and 2.7.0 or later versions will support upgrading indefinitely.
		* URL input types (Canonical, Redirect) are now `url` instead of `text`. This means you need to supply a correct URL according to the browser, instead that only TSF checks for correctness after it's being saved.
		* Term title prefixes are now applied to Open Graph and Twitter titles too.
		* The [Schema.org effort states](https://schema.org/docs/faq.html#19) they're moving towards and are going to prefer HTTPS. So, after two years including some testing, we abide to be future-proof. Note that it's a parameter, not a link.
		* On post preview, the plugin no longer outputs SEO meta. This is to prevent object caching conflicts.
		* On post preview, the plugin no longer redirects. This is to prevent browser caching conflicts.
		* The sitemap's "generated by" mark now leads to our homepage, instead of the WordPress.org plugin page. The URL is still invisible and otherwise blocked from robots, and can be easily removed using the [Incognito extension](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/incognito/).
		* The "Home" URL in the plugin activation page is now dubbed "About".
		* Description additions are automatically turned off now on new sites.
		* Link relationship tags for Posts and Pages are now automatically enabled on new installations, because there's no longer a performance impact.
		* The sitemap's timestamp options are now found under the new "Metadata" tab.
		* The title's separator option is now found under the "Additions" tab.
		* This plugin now removes WooCommerce's breadcrumbs, to prevent output conflict, regardless of TSF's Structured Data settings.
	* **Updated:**
		* Most, if not all, database transients related to this plugin have been invalidated and are being rebuilt. The old transients will be cleaned up by WordPress automatically.
		* Various [?]-links have been updated. Some were redirecting, others had the URL fragment adjusted.
		* The "SEOPress" plugin is now detected as a conflicting SEO plugin.
		* These plugins are no longer detected as conflicting plugins:
			* Open Graph:
				* "Fedmich's Facebook Open Graph Meta" - No longer updated, low user base.
				* "Facebook AWD All in one" - No longer updated, low user base.
				* "Facebook Featured Image & OG Meta Tags" - No longer updated, low user base.
				* "Facebook Meta Tags" - No longer updated, low user base.
				* "Add Link to Facebook" - No longer updated, relative low user base, closed for security reasons.
			* Twitter:
				* "Twitter" - they only embed sharing links.
		* Bing Webmaster's verification code link now leads to their new landing page.
		* Yandex Webmaster's verification code link now leads to their new landing page.
	* **Removed:**
		* Counters now only work with JavaScript enabled. In PHP, this added too much overhead as we were predicting and counting in code.
		* Description excerpts are no longer added to categories based on the latest post ID.
		* Open Graph, Twitter, and SEO plugins no longer disables certain functionality in the plugin.
			* Instead, only a warning is shown on the settings page.
			* We made this change as some users found this plugin to be broken when trying it out, while it was actually preventing conflicts when other plugins remained active.
		* When a sitemap file or plugin is found, this plugin no longer removes its related settings.
			* Instead, only a warning is shown on the settings page, telling that the options have no effect.
		* AnsPress title compatibility, they handle this correctly.
		* JetPack Open Graph compatibility checks, they handle this since 2016, and improved upon this since JetPack v6.4.
		* Description output caching. It causes too much overhead, and it provides no benefit any longer. In fact, it degrades performance.
		* `noydir` robots meta tag. It's no longer used by any search engine.
	* **Fixed:**
		* When reactivating or deactivating the plugin, there's no longer a chance for your SEO options to be wiped on a random database error.
			* We used to delete the options, so we could reactivate option-auto-loading; now we add a buster-timestamp.
		* Various RTL UI elements are now aligned correctly.
		* On Firefox, checkbox options marked "default" (recommended) or "warned" (use at own risk) are now color-coded again.
		* When adding a new category when no category is selected, the primary term is now correctly assigned.
		* When the primary term selection changed after load and when a new category is added, the previous category is no longer assigned as primary.
		* Twitter description and title fields now render escaped `<&'">` characters in placeholders correctly when fetched from related Open Graph fields.
		* When no description or title is found for the corresponding Open Graph or Twitter fields, no more infinite loop will occur that might crash the browser. Luckily, modern browsers detect this to prevent said crashes.
		* When the homepage is a blog, it'll now be included in the sitemap again.
		* Thanks to the upgrade to PHP 5.4, the SEO bar can now count words with non-latin special characters.
			* In their normal form of writing, it's not able to count han characters.
		* When no tagline is set in the WordPress settings, the home page will no longer display "Untitled on Site name" for the description by default.
		* The SEO Bar's title suggestion now interprets title protection, like "Private:" and "Protected:".
		* Quotes and other special characters in titles and descriptions are now correctly calculated by the SEO Bar.
			* Note that double single-quotes will be converted to single double-quotes, and they'll therefore be counted as one character.
		* Ultimate Member support:
			* The Canonical URL is now correct.
			* The Descriptions are now correct.
			* The Titles are now fully controlled by TSF.
			* Extranous (duplicated) meta output from Ultimate Member has been removed.
		* Invalid settings' input are now checked, this makes the saving buttons work as intended:
			* Before you can change tabs. It'll block the tab switch and notify you.
			* After you close a metabox, and it'll reopen instantly to notify you.
		* The SEO Bar no longer incorretly tells that CPT categories or tags are discouraged from indexing via the global settings.
		* WC Shop and Blog pages canonical URLs now correctly output pagination.
		* WC Shop and Blog pages shortlink URLs now correctly output pagination.
		* Search pages now correctly output pagination.
		* The title metabox's example title (from the latest post) can now be substituted for the example title when empty.
		* Term titles no longer have their HTML tags stripped in the generated SEO titles by default.
		* When no blog description or tagline is set, the left/right example titles are no longer partially emptied when JS is deactivated.
		* Duplicated spaces are no longer counted by the pixel and character counters, and they'll be removed from the front-end output.
		* Entering lone spaces in the title and descriptions will no longer set the pixel and character counters to 0.
		* IE11 pixel and character counters now work correctly again when a HTML symbol is introduced.
		* Settings are now correctly registered before the plugin tries to upgrade.
		* The sitemap is now correctly registered via `WP_Rewrite` when the plugin is installed for the first time.
		* When you try to leave the page, TSF no longer conflicts with other plugins (two-way street) when trying to warn you of unsaved data.
		* Migrating Genesis theme term-meta now has an effect on the front-end too, instead of only the administrative option fields.
		* Parent categories where children have posts are no longer automatically and incorrectly marked for "noindex" in the SEO Bar when no posts are assigned.
			* This didn't affect the real, front-end output value.
		* Interactive tooltips arrows now no longer overflow when the balloon size becomes smaller.
		* The primary term selector no longer overflows to the bottom. Instead, the text flows neatly to the bottom, while the button stays inline.
		* Titles and descriptions now have no chance from experiencing ID conflicts, where a post and term ID might collide.
		* When entering something in the Open Graph description or title fields, and then emptying it, and then entering something in the meta description or title fields, will no longer cause the Twitter title to use the latest known meta description or title field from when the Open Graph field got emptied. Whew (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
		* When JavaScript is enabled, the social description placeholders now show their front-end value when no custom description is set.

* **For translators:**
	* **New translations are available.**
	* **Notes:**
		* We no longer list every single linguistic change here. It's very tedious and slows down development time tremendously.
		* In this update, you'll find that languages that use grammatical gender can be more incisive.
		* All new translatable strings are available at the [translation page](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/autodescription).

* **For developers:**
	* **Tips:**
		* Want to check if TSF is activated? Use: `defined( 'THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_PRESENT' )`.
		* Want to use TSF's API? You're in (fail)safe hands with `the_seo_framework()`.
		* Want to make sure you can use TSF's API? Call `the_seo_framework()->loaded`.
	* **Note:**
		* We tried to list every single change here; but, we could've overlooked a thing or two. Test your code!
	* **Added:**
		* Singleton class `\The_SEO_Framework\Builders\Scripts`, via a "Builder Pattern", callable as e.g. `the_seo_framework()->Scripts()::function_name()`.
			* This is the first class of this kind in The SEO Framework plugin.
		* The plugin now tries to remove all active `wp_title` filters, like it has been doing for `pre_get_document_title` a long time.
		* New option indexes, available via `the_seo_framework()->get_option( $index )`, serialized on option `autodescription-site-settings`:
			* `(array) disabled_post_types`
			* `(array) the_seo_framework()->get_robots_post_type_option_id( 'noindex' )`
			* `(array) the_seo_framework()->get_robots_post_type_option_id( 'nofollow' )`
			* `(array) the_seo_framework()->get_robots_post_type_option_id( 'noarchive' )`
			* `(int) (bool) auto_description`
			* `(int) (bool) title_strip_tags`
			* `(string) homepage_og_title`
			* `(string) homepage_og_description`
			* `(string) homepage_twitter_title`
			* `(string) homepage_twitter_description`
			* `(int) sitemap_query_limit`
		* The sitemap xsl stylesheet now has its colors defined in various `xsl:variable` elements. It's also completely reconfigurable via hooks.
		* The plugin now initializes options cache. For instance, when the plugin's activated a temporarily value will be set that it did.
		* Various JS functions and class objects have been introduced. These are available via the API, but shouldn't be used as the JS API is still under consideration and can change at any update.
		* An initial database version option has been added. This is `the_seo_framework_initial_db_version`, it's only used in the upgrading process, and it's not autoloaded.
		* [JavaScript]: Input fields within TSF's metaboxes with the class `tsf-input-not-saved` set will not invoke an "unsaved-work" AYS notice on page-navigation.
		* [JavaScript]: `tsf.i18n.inputGuidelines` is now available.
		* [JavaScript]: `tsf.params.inputGuidelines` is now available.
		* [JavaScript]: `tsf.params.socialPlaceholders` is now available.
		* [JavaScript]: `tsf.states.isGutenbergPage` is now available.
	* **Improved:**
		* A "doing it wrong" notice is now supplied when calling `the_seo_framework()` too early.
		* Fixed all "non-passive event listener" warnings caused by jQuery, by using our improved own event handlers.
		* The "doing it wrong" notice on "too early" query calls now shows the query-class method called.
	* **Changed:**
		* The title generation has been overhauled.
		* The plugin now loads within the `/bootstrap/` folder via the plugin's initial `autodescription.php` file, where you can more easily discern how the plugin's loaded.
		* [JavaScript]: Tooltips are now instanced via their own object named `window.tsfTT`, eliminating the previous JS API.
			* The auto-invoked API still works as intended, via CSS.
		* [JavaScript]: Media handlers are now instanced via their own object named `window.tsfMedia`, eliminating the previous JS API.
		* [JavaScript]: Primary Term handlers are now instanced via their own object named `window.tsfPT`, eliminating the previous JS API.
		* [JavaScript]: `tsf.params.titleAdditions` now always contains a value, unconditionally. Use `tsf.states.useTagline` and `tsf.states.taglineLocked` to determine whether it should be used (before settings change).
		* The WordPress filter `pre_ent2ncr` can now run on filter `the_seo_framework_sitemap_additional_urls`.
		* The WordPress filter `single_post_title` is now used for singular post titles.
		* Query caching is now disabled in WP_CLI.
		* Integral options (1, 0, or a number) now return an integer, instead of a number encapsulated in a string.
		* Calling any class of the `the_seo_framework()` façade other than `\The_SEO_Framework\Init` will result in a fatal error. The `\The_SEO_Framework\Core` constructor is now private and inherited by all classes but `\The_SEO_Framework\Init`.
			* In other words: Don't instantiate the façade. Just use `the_seo_framework()`.
	* **Removed:**
		* We removed the `seotips` folder and their contents. They were a gimmick, accumulating SEO tips brought over past plugin update changelogs.
		* Many deprecated methods, which were deprecated on or before TSF v2.9.4 (August 30, 2017).
		* The plugin's automagic-upgrader has been removed, which has been replaced with a static, ordered and semantic plugin upgrader since TSF v2.7.0.
		* Meta-generator methods' debugging have been removed, along with all the debugging methods used for that.
		* Title "doing it wrong" checks have been removed.
		* [JavaScript]: `tsf.params.titlePixelGuideline` is no longer available.
		* [JavaScript]: `tsf.params.descPixelGuideline` is no longer available.
		* [JavaScript]: `tsf.i18n.good` is no longer available.
		* [JavaScript]: `tsf.i18n.okay` is no longer available.
		* [JavaScript]: `tsf.i18n.bad` is no longer available.
		* [JavaScript]: `tsf.i18n.unknown` is no longer available.
	* **Fixed:**
		* The wpForo title compatibility filter no longer emits a PHP notice when no title is generated from their plugin.
		* A highly unlikely PHP error now won't occur when `$wpdb` returns incomplete data on excluded archive/search IDs.
		* A PHP notice and unintentionally false-esque return value when the post ID is 0, or when the post ID is excluded, in method `is_post_included_in_sitemap()`.
		* A PHP warning is no longer omitted caused by a referencing parameter in `\The_SEO_Framework\_bbpress_filter_do_adjust_query()`.
		* The SEO Bar can now read filters applied to titles.
		* When a custom social image goes missing, no PHP notices (regarding uncountable) will be emitted when their dimensions are calculated anymore.
	* **Class notes:**
		 * **Added:**
		 	* `\The_SEO_Framework\Silencer`, called when `\The_SEO_Framework\Load` is blocked from loading in filters.
	* **Constant notes:**
		* **Added:**
			* `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_PRESENT`, defined when the plugin gets past environmental tests.
			* `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_BOOTSTRAP_PATH`, holds the bootstrap folder's path.
			* `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_DIR_PATH_TRAIT`, holds the plugin traits' folder's path.

	* **Action notes:**

			* `the_seo_framework_loaded`. Runs after the plugin factory is loaded on any end.
			* `the_seo_framework_after_init`. Runs after the plugin has initialized its admin or front-end hooks. See also, the admin-only hook: `the_seo_framework_after_admin_init`.

	* **Filter notes:**
		* **Added:**
			* `(array) the_seo_framework_scripts`, allows you to adjust (or add to) the default script parameters.
			* `(string) the_seo_framework_title_from_custom_field`, the meta title from custom fields.
			* `(string) the_seo_framework_title_from_generation`, the meta title from (inputted/detected) query.
			* `(array) the_seo_framework_sitemap_styles`, the sitemap styles.
			* `(string) the_seo_framework_site_cache`, the cache option value.
			* `(array) the_seo_framework_inpost_seo_save_defaults`, the post SEO data defaults. Note that this doesn't change the post data prior saving.
			* `(array) the_seo_framework_save_custom_fields`, the post SEO data, right before it's saved.
			* `(array) the_seo_framework_save_term_data`, the term SEO data, right before it's saved.
			* `(array) the_seo_framework_separator_list`, the separator list.
			* `(array) the_seo_framework_input_guidelines`, the input guideline list.
		* **Changed:**
			* `the_seo_framework_detect_page_builder`
				1. Now returns `null` by default.
				2. Now, when a boolean (either true or false) is defined, it'll short-circuit this function. See [this comment](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework/issues/279#issuecomment-392735509) for more information.
			* `the_seo_framework_sitemap_post_limit` now returns an option value.
			* `the_seo_framework_custom_post_type_support` is now checked on presence. This is cached. If your filter is added too late, it won't work.
			* `the_seo_framework_sitemap_color_main`, it now reflects the main color, instead of the accent color.
			* `the_seo_framework_sitemap_color_accent`, it now reflects the accent color, instead of the main color.
			* `the_seo_framework_ogimage_output`, when the output is empty, the `og:image` output will no longer continue.
			* `the_seo_framework_seo_plugin_detected`, `the_seo_framework_og_plugin_detected`, `the_seo_framework_seo_plugin_detected`, and `the_seo_framework_sitemap_plugin_detected`:
				1. When filtered to be false, other plugins are still checked.
				2. Added two new parameters.
			* `the_seo_framework_term_meta_defaults` is now also used on the front-end.
			* `the_seo_framework_custom_field_description` now passes a 'taxonomy' index in the second parameter.
			* `the_seo_framework_fetched_description_excerpt` no longer passes a third and fourth parameter.
			* `the_seo_framework_supported_post_type`, the first parameter is always a boolean, and no longer the accepted post type string.
				* Use the second parameter to get the evaluated post type, instead.
		* **Removed:**
			* `the_seo_framework_update_options_at_update`
			* `the_seo_framework_canonical_force_scheme` (was deprecated since 2.8.0). Use `the_seo_framework_preferred_url_scheme` instead.
			* `the_seo_framework_seo_bar_pill`, and all related supporting visuals -- for improved browser painting performance.
			* `the_seo_framework_admin_color_css`, we standardized this filter's behavior into the new script handler via other means.
			* **Title related:**
				* `the_seo_framework_title_args`
				* `the_seo_framework_search_title`
				* `the_seo_framework_pre_add_title`, use `the_seo_framework_title_from_generation` instead.
				* `the_seo_framework_pro_add_title`, use `the_seo_framework_title_from_generation` instead.

				* `the_seo_framework_title_pagination`
				* `the_seo_framework_title_seplocation_front`, use the options API instead.
				* `the_seo_framework_title_seplocation`, use the options API instead.
			* `the_seo_framework_inpost_seo_bar`, use the option introduced in TSF 2.7 instead.
			* `the_seo_framework_generator_tag`, it's useless and you can do it via `add_action( 'wp_head', function() { echo <meta.../>; } );`
			* `the_seo_framework_updates_cache`, it wasn't used.
			* `the_seo_framework_generated_description_additions`, use the new options instead.
		* **Deprecated:**
			* `the_seo_framework_get_term_meta`, use `the_seo_framework_term_meta_defaults` instead.
		* **Fixed:**
			* `the_seo_framework_default_site_options` Now runs whenever default options are called. So, it's much more predictable, like when resetting options.
	* **Structural notes:**
		* **Added:**
			* Folder `/bootstrap/`, with:
				* `activation.php`
				* `deactivation.php`
				* `define.php`
				* `envtest.php`
