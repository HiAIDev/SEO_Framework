= Unbranded, Free and for the Professional =
This plugin is unbranded! This means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within the WordPress interface, aside from the plugin activation page. This plugin makes great use of the default WordPress interface elements, like as if this plugin is part of WordPress. No ads, no nags. The small and hidden HTML comments can easily be disabled with the use of a filter or extension.

Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your or someone else's website. A clean interface, for everyone.

= Completely automated =
**By default, this plugin automatically generates:**

* Titles according to your settings with archive prefixes.
* Descriptions with anti-spam techniques and detection that informs you when it can be improved.
* A canonical URL to prevent duplicated content; with full "domain mapping", subdomain, and HTTPS support.
* Various Open Graph, Facebook and Twitter tags.
* Special Open Graph descriptions, which organically integrates within the Facebook and Twitter snippets.
* Open Graph images, they are automatically resized and optimized when needed.
* Structured Data for Google Search and Chromium that adds extended on-site search support.
* Structured Data for Google's Knowledge Graph; like Personal/Business site relations, names, and logos.
* Structured Data for Breadcrumbs that extend pages and categories relationship support in Google Search.
* Structured Data for Google Search that lets it know your preferred site name.
* Publishing and editing dates for social sites and search engines alike.
* Paginated content relationship links, to help visitors going to the right page.
* A sitemap with all your pages, posts and CPT, which listens to their page settings.
* Feed excerpts and backlinks within, to reduce automated content theft.

**This plugin goes further, behind the screens it:**

* Prevents canonical errors with categories, pages, subdomains and Multisite Domain Mapping.
* Discourages 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even if they don't send a 404 response.
* Automatically notifies Google, Bing, and Yandex on website updates when sitemaps are enabled.

= Generously personal =
**This plugin allows you to manually set various values for each post, page, public CPT, and term.**

**This plugin allows you to adjust over 100 site settings, including:**

* Automated title output options; they encourage you to follow the guidelines.
* Automated description output options.
* Schema.org structured data output options.
* Various robots meta output options.
* Many home page specific options.
* Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest social integration options.
* Google, Bing, Pinterest and Yandex webmaster verification codes.
* Sitemap integration with personalization.
* Robots.txt sitemap integration.
* Feed anti-scraper options.
* And many, many more settings.

= Openly pluggable =
The SEO Framework has been built to go further than just itself.
Take a look at the API documentation located at [The SEO Framework API Docs](http://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= The SEO Bar =
**This plugin helps you to create better content, at a glance. By showing you:**

* If the title is too long, too short, duplicated, and/or automatically generated.
* If the description is too long, too short, duplicated, has too many repeated words and/or automatically generated.
* If the page is indexed, redirected, followed and/or archived, while looking at other WordPress settings.

**We call this the SEO Bar. Check out the [Screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/#screenshots) to see how it helps you!**

= Hardcore caching =
This plugin's code is highly optimized on PHP-level and uses variable, object and transient caching. This means that there's little extra page load time from this plugin, even with more meta tags used.

A caching plugin isn't even needed for this plugin as you won't notice a difference; however, it's supported wherever best suited.

= Compatibility =
**This plugin supports:**

* PHP 5.4 and higher.
* WordPress 4.6 and higher.
* Internationalization through WordPress.org.
* Multibyte calculation and rendering, including Emoji and CJK.
* Right to Left (RTL) languages, through its interface and generation.
* Extended color vision deficiency accessibility.
* Screen reader accessibility.
* Multisite, this plugin is in fact built upon one.
* Detection of robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.
* Both up-to-date and outdated themes.
* Detection of various other popular SEO tools to prevent duplicated output.
* Translation plugins like WPML, Polylang, WPGlobus and MultilingualPress.
* WooCommerce, for free, in all its glory.

= An additional sitemap =
The sitemap generated with The SEO Framework is sufficient for search engines to find posts, pages and supported custom post types throughout your website. It also listens to the "noindex" settings on each of the items and works great with various translation plugins.

However, if you require a more expanded sitemap, feel free to activate a dedicated Sitemap plugin. The SEO Framework will automatically deactivate its Sitemap functionality when another (known) sitemap plugin is found. If it is not automatically detected and no notification has been provided in the Sitemap Settings, feel free to open a support ticket and it will be addressed carefully.

= Hidden breadcrumbs =
The Breadcrumb script generated by this plugin on Posts will also make sure Google easily finds related categories which aren't included in the Sitemap of this plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework Free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads or nags!
This plugin is all-inclusive without upsells.

= Is there more? =

For more advanced SEO options and output, we offer the free plugin [Extension Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-extension-manager/).

= I have a feature request, I've found a bug, a plugin is incompatible... =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell us about it.
We'll try to get back to you within 72 hours. :)

= I am a developer; how can I help? =

Any input is greatly appreciated, and everything will be considered.
Please visit the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework) to submit issues or even pull requests.

= I want to modify how this plugin works. =

The SEO Framework is very pluggable in many fields. Please refer to the [API documentation](https://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, news, etc. is this OK? =

This is not an issue. Search engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.
If a visitor can't find a page, then why would a search engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's usability.

Check out our [Extension Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-extension-manager/).
It contains extensions, like Articles, that fill in the gaps with newer techniques.

= The sitemap contains unwanted links. =

The SEO Framework takes all publicly queryable posts, pages, and CPT and puts them in the sitemap.

If you don't want a page in the sitemap, consider enabling the `noindex` option. This will also remove the page from search engine result pages.

If the link shouldn't be in the sitemap because it's meant for structural reasons, then inform the plugin or theme author that created them.
You should tell the author to check out the "`public` and `rewrite` post type arguments". The plugin or theme author should know that that means.

= What's do the application/ld+json scripts do? =

The JSON-LD scripts are search engine helpers which tell search engines how to connect and index the site.
They can tell the search engine if your site contains an internal search engine, what sites you're socially connected to and what page structure you're using.
This is also referred to as "Structured Data".

= The metadata is not being updated, and I'm using a caching plugin. =

All The SEO Framework's metadata is put into Object cache when a caching plugin is available.
The descriptions and Schema.org scripts are put into Transients.
Please be sure to clear your cache or adjust the plugin's caching settings if deemed necessary.

= I want to transport SEO data from other plugins to The SEO Framework, how do I do this? =

Please refer to this small guide: [SEO Data Migration](http://theseoframework.com/docs/seo-data-migration/).
Transporting Categories, Tags and other terms' SEO data isn't supported.

== Changelog ==

= 3.1.0 - TODO =

**Release date**

* July TODOth, 2018

**Summarized:**

* TODO

**For developers: About the API**

* We've removed or otherwise deprecated most API functions. We've done this to lower maintenance time drastically.
* We encourage you to always use the factory function `the_seo_framework()`. Via this factory function, you can access all API methods when needed.
* The factory function yields many failsafe capturers so we can make future changes with peace of mind. This isn't possible with PHP functions.
* As more than three quarters the plugin's code is dormant on most pages, in future major releases we're going to cut off the "façade" class loading (where everything's accessible via `$this`), and split them into interfacing factories, e.g.: `the_seo_framework()->generate( 'url' )::set( 'id', 1 )::get( 'relative' )`. More on this will follow for 3.2 or later after a class-map draft is set up. Or goal is to minimize performance overhead; aiming to improve it further.

## Detailed log

* **For everyone:**
	* **Added:**
		/
		* TODO
	* **Improved:**
		/
		* TODO
		* The plugin can now downgrade its database version to the currently installed version automatically. This makes sure necessary future upgrade procedures are reinstated when you choose to downgrade (for any reason).
			* Since TSF v3.0.6 this happens when the user saved the options, but this could lead to inconsistent behavior on WordPress Multisite installations.
		* We removed a lot of redundant code (like option upgrade checks), which have long been superseded by better standards.
		* Code and URL input types (Twitter profile, Webmasters' verification codes) now always flow from left to right, even if your site's written language setting is otherwise.
	* **Changed:**
		/
		* TSF now requires WordPress 4.6, from WordPress 4.4.
		* TSF now requires PHP 5.4, from PHP 5.6.
		* URL input types (Canonical, Redirect) are now `url` instead of `text`. This means you need to supply a correct URL according to the browser, instead that only TSF checks for correctness after it's being saved.
	* **Removed:**
		/
		* TODO
	* **Fixed:**
		/
		* When reactivating the plugin, there's no longer a chance for your SEO options to be wiped on a random database error.
			* We used to delete the options, so we could reactivate option-auto-loading; now we add a buster-timestamp.
		* Various RTL UI elements are now aligned correctly.
		* TODO

* **For translators:**
	* **Added:**

		* TODO Location:
			* TODO "Sentences"
	* **Updated:**

	* **Changed:**

		* "New SEO Settings have been updated"

* **For developers:**
	* **Tips:**
		* Want to check if TSF is activated? Use: `defined( 'THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_PRESENT' )`.
		* Want to use TSF's API? You're in (fail)safe hands with `the_seo_framework()`.
		* Want to make sure you can use TSF's API? Call `the_seo_framework()->loaded`.
	* **Added:**
		/
		* TODO
	* **Improved:**
		/
		* TODO
		* A "doing it wrong" notice is now supplied when calling `the_seo_framework()` too early.
	* **Changed:**
		/
		* The plugin now loads within the `/bootstrap/` folder via the plugin's initial `autodescription.php` file, where you can more easily discern how the plugin's loaded.
		* TODO
	* **Removed:**
		/
		* We removed the `seotips` folder and their contents. They were a gimmick, accumulating SEO tips brought over past plugin update changelogs.
		* Many deprecated methods, which were deprecated on or before TSF v2.9.4 (August 30, 2017).
		* The plugin's automagic-upgrader has been removed, which has been replaced with a static, ordered and semantic plugin upgrader since TSF v2.7.0.
		* TODO `the_seo_framework()->theme_doing_it_right_transient` and all that's related.
		* TODO
	* **Fixed:**
		/
		* The wpForo title compatibility filter no longer emits a PHP notice when no title is generated from their plugin.
		* A highly unlikely PHP error now won't occur when `$wpdb` returns incomplete data on excluded archive/search IDs.
		* TODO
	* **Class notes:**
