= Unbranded, Free and for the Professional =
This plugin is unbranded! This means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within the WordPress interface, aside from the plugin activation page.
This plugin makes great use of the default WordPress interface elements, like as if this plugin is part of WordPress. No ads, no nags.
The small and hidden HTML comments can easily be disabled with the use of a filter or extension.

Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your or someone else's website. A clean interface, for everyone.

= Completely automated =
**By default, this plugin automatically generates:**

* Titles according to your settings with archive prefixes.
* Descriptions with anti-spam techniques and detection that informs you when it can be improved.
* A canonical URL to prevent duplicated content; with full Domain Mapping, subdomain, and HTTPS support.
* Various Open Graph, Facebook and Twitter tags.
* Special Open Graph descriptions, which organically integrates within the Facebook and Twitter snippets.
* Open Graph images, they are automatically resized and optimized when needed.
* Structured Data for Google Search and Chromium that adds extended on-site search support.
* Structured Data for Google's Knowledge Graph; like Personal/Business site relations, names, and logos.
* Structured Data for Breadcrumbs that extend pages and categories relationship support in Google Search.
* Structured Data for Google Search that lets it know your preferred site name.
* Publishing and editing dates for Social Sites and Search Engines alike.
* Paginated content relationship links, to help visitors going to the right page.
* A sitemap with all your pages, posts and CPT, which listens to their set settings.
* Feed excerpts and backlinks within, to prevent automated content theft.

**This plugin goes further, behind the screens it:**

* Prevents canonical errors with categories, pages, subdomains and Multisite Domain Mapping.
* Discourages 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even if they don't send a 404 response.
* Automatically notifies Google, Bing, and Yandex on website updates when sitemaps are enabled.

= Generously personal =
**This plugin allows you to manually set various values for each post, page, public CPT, and term.**

**This plugin allows you to adjust over 100 site settings, including:**

* Automated title output options; they encourage you to follow the guidelines.
* Automated description output options.
* Schema.org Structured Data output options.
* Various robots meta output options.
* Many home page specific options.
* Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest social integration options.
* Google, Bing, Pinterest and Yandex Webmaster verification codes.
* Sitemap integration with personalization.
* Robots.txt sitemap integration.
* Feed anti-scraper options.
* And many, many more settings.

= Openly pluggable =
The SEO Framework has been built to go further than just itself.
Take a look at the API documentation located at [The SEO Framework API Docs](http://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= The SEO Bar =
**This plugin helps you to create better content, at a glance. By showing you:**

* If the title is too long, too short, duplicated, and/or automatically generated.
* If the description is too long, too short, duplicated, has too many repeated words and/or automatically generated.
* If the page is indexed, redirected, followed and/or archived, while looking at other WordPress settings.

**We call this The SEO Bar. Check out the [Screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/#screenshots) to see how it helps you!**

= Hardcore caching =
This plugin's code is highly optimized on PHP-level and uses variable, object and transient caching. This means that there's little extra page load time from this plugin, even with more meta tags used.
A caching plugin isn't even needed for this plugin as you won't notice a difference; however, it's supported wherever best suited.

= Compatibility =
**This plugin supports:**

* PHP 5.3 and higher.
* WordPress 4.4 and higher.
* Internationalization through WordPress.org.
* Multibyte calculation and rendering, including Emoji and CJK.
* Right to Left (RTL) languages, through its interface and generation.
* Extended Color vision deficiency accessibility.
* Screen reader accessibility.
* MultiSite, this plugin is in fact built upon one.
* Detection of robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.
* Both up-to-date and outdated themes.
* Detection of various other popular SEO tools to prevent duplicated output.
* Translation plugins WPML, Polylang and qTranslate X.
* WooCommerce, for free, in all its glory.

**If you have other popular SEO plugins activated, this plugin will automatically prevent SEO mistakes by deactivating itself on almost every part.**

= An additional sitemap =
The sitemap generated with The SEO Framework is sufficient for Search Engines to find posts, pages and supported custom post types throughout your website.
It also listens to the "noindex" settings on each of the items and works great with various translation plugins.
However, if you require a more expanded sitemap, feel free to activate a dedicated Sitemap plugin. The SEO Framework will automatically deactivate its Sitemap functionality when another (known) sitemap plugin is found.
If it is not automatically detected and no notification has been provided in the Sitemap Settings, feel free to open a support ticket and it will be addressed carefully.

= Hidden breadcrumbs =
The Breadcrumb script generated by this plugin on Posts will also make sure Google easily finds related categories which aren't included in the Sitemap of this plugin.

1. Install The SEO Framework either via the WordPress.org plugin directory or by uploading the files to your server.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework Free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads or nags!

= Is there a Premium version? =

Nope! This plugin is all-inclusive.

= Free & Premium Extensions =

For more advanced SEO options and output, we offer the free plugin [Extension Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-extension-manager/).

= I have a feature request, I've found a bug, a plugin is incompatible... =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell me about it. I try to get back to you within 48 hours. :)

= Is this really a Framework? =

The SEO Framework is its own self-serving technical framework. It keeps track of everything WordPress and SEO while it allows other plugins to interact with it easily.
Through its framework it allows you to SEO your complete website. It also allows for extensions and real-time alterations; for when you really want or need to change something.
Extensions built for this plugin might just as well work as a standalone; however, The SEO Framework provides an easier and faster way of doing so.

= I am a developer; how can I help? =

The SEO Framework is currently a one-man project. However, any input is greatly appreciated and everything will be considered.
Please visit the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework) to submit issues or even pull requests.

= I want to modify how this plugin works =

The SEO Framework is very pluggable in many fields. Please refer to the [API documentation](https://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, news, etc. is this OK? =

This is not an issue. Search Engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.
If a visitor can't find a page, then why would a Search Engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's usability.

= What's do the application/ld+json scripts do? =

The JSON-LD scripts are Search Engine helpers which tell Search Engines how to connect and index the site.
They can tell the Search Engine if your site contains an internal search engine, what sites you're socially connected to and what page structure you're using.
This is also referred to as Structured Data.

= The metadata is not being updated, and I'm using a caching plugin. =

All The SEO Framework's metadata is put into Object cache when a caching plugin is available. The descriptions and Schema.org scripts are put into Transients. Please be sure to clear your cache.

= I want to transport SEO data from other plugins to The SEO Framework, how do I do this? =

Please refer to this small guide: [SEO Data Migration](http://theseoframework.com/docs/seo-data-migration/).
Transporting Terms and Taxonomies SEO data isn't supported.

== Changelog ==

= 2.9.2 - ??? (dwarves thing) =

**Release date:**

* May 7th, 2017

**Summarized:**

* Now, PolyLang is officially supported by The SEO Framework :)
* Plain (ugly) permalinks are now also fully supported. So even the sitemap output will work.
* The robots.txt file has been enhanced, so it now informs you when the output location is incorrect.
* TODO

**We're looking for translation editors:**

* First, thank you so much to all the translation [contributors](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/autodescription/contributors).
* Now, if you want to see The SEO Framework in your language, head over to [this page](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/autodescription) and feel free to contribute.
* If you wish to easily maintain and keep a close eye on all the contributions for your language, [ask us](https://theseoframework.com/contact/) to ask WordPress Polyglots to add you as a contributor.
* Ultimately, it's up to the WordPress Polyglots team to fulfill your request. It generally depends on how well you've submitted translations for you to be accepted.

**A few notes about translations:**

* If you use a machine to translate for you, note that they can generate out-of-context strings. So keep an eye out for those!
* If you notice that strings are very hard to translate, e.g. because of grammatical gender, [let us know](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework/issues/new)!
* Please don't translate "The SEO Framework", it's a registered brand-name.
* Be sure not to add spaces if you see backticks, asterisks, or brackets. They're used for Markdown language construction.
* In TSF, you generally can't use UTF character codes like `&#x2661;`, as they're automatically removed or rendered unreadable for added security. Add them as displayed instead: ♡.

* **For everyone:**
	* **Added:**
		* The sitemap and its stylesheet can now be output when using plain permalinks.
			* This doesn't mean that you should use permalinks in the first place.
	* **Improved:**
		* If an admin redirect initiated by TSF causes a white screen of death, a helping message is now outputted on the white screen.
		* When using WPML, the URLs are now converted much faster than before.
		* On plugin activation and deactivation, the options are now automatically toggled from options autoload.
		 	* For non-developers, this means that this plugin won't stock up on your website's memory after deactivation. Unlike many, many other plugins.
		* The sitemap's stylesheet is now a bit neater when `lastmod` output is disabled.
		* PolyLang canonical URL compatibility.
		* A little link in plugin activation page to the companion plugin to inform wary users about its existence, which next to the deactivation link.
			* This link is only added if the plugin isn't found to be installed.
			* This link is super non-intrusive; most won't even spot it.
			* This link is named "Extensions".
		* When using a translation plugin, the plugin now pings Search Engines with your current admin language's sitemap, rather than the default one.
		* When using a translation plugin, the robots.txt output now directs Search Engines to the current language's sitemap location.
			* This only works when using domain or subdomain translation URLs. Subdomain translation URLs are highly discouraged, and this is another reason.
			* For more information, visit [robotstxt.org](http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html).
		* The robots.txt file will now show a notification when it's at an invalid location, whilst pointing you to the "supposed" location.
			* It can't check whether that location is a valid robots.txt file without using excessive server resources.
			* For that, please sign up with [The SEO Framework - Extension Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-extension-manager/)'s Monitor, which allows you to excessively use my servers' resources.
				* An update that checks for this has recently been implemented on the Monitor server.
			* For more information, visit [robotstxt.org](http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html).
		* Paginated URLs generation performance has been vastly improved.
			* There were heavy things calculated that were unused half of the time.
	* **Changed:**
		* The URL generation now uses WordPress default home URL generation, rather than our own.
		* The General Settings meta box tabs have been reordered, so new users won't be overwhelmed with advanced options at first sight.
		* The sitemap settings are now output when using Plain permalinks.
			* Instead, the Robots.txt tab will now show a notice. Because that does require pretty permalinks.
	* **Updated:**
		* Knowledge Graph Social Profile links' placeholders and example profile redirect links.
		* The sitemap cache will be cleared on update, because of the URL fixes.
		* TODO Fix last 2 images in Screenshots
	* **Fixed:**
		* When using WPML, alternative languages' terms and taxonomies URLs are now correct.
		* wpForo plugin compatibility has been implemented, so canonical URLs, titles, and descriptions are always correct on wpForo pages.
			* This only works if bbPress isn't active.
		* Home URL ports are now also considered.
		* EdgeHTML in-post meta box' contents overflowed when placed in the sidebar or on a mobile-sized screen.
		* Prevented memory leak when re-selecting social images.
		* The sitemap's stylesheet now works on translated (alternative) domains.
		* When using PolyLang, the Canonical URLs no longer mismatches.
		* TODO check if description generation is RTL supported.

* **For translators:**
	* **Plugin home:**
		* The "others notes" have been summarized in a FAQ entry.
		* Various other changes to respect the new WordPress plugin directory layout.
		* Improved grammar, mainly Oxford commas.
	* **Plugin code:**
		* **Updated:**
			* POT translation file.
				* Translations are handled through [WordPress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/autodescription).
		* **Added:**
			* "There has been an error redirecting. Refresh the page or follow [this link](%s)."
				* This is shown when admin redirection fails because of PHP debugging issues.
				* It uses Markdown.
			* "Extensions"
				* Yes, there are official plugin extensions.
			* "https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-extension-manager/"
				* Please translate it to your WordPress.org language's location. Like "nl.wordpress.org".
				* This accounts for many other WordPress.org links.
		* **Changed:**
			* The plugin indication strings have been adjusted.
				* So, "Start/End The SEO Framework" now is "Start/End %s".
				* Many translators translated a brand name, which shouldn't be.
					* This means "The SEO Framework" should always stay "The SEO Framework".
					* Not e.g. "De SEO Lijstwerk" (Dutch).
			* "Only adjust these options if you are aware of its SEO effects."
				* Now is: "Only adjust these options if you are aware of their SEO effects."
				* Grammar: The subject (options) is plural.
			* "Change your Permalink Settings %s (Recommended: 'postname')."
				* Now is: 'Change your Permalink Settings %s (Recommended: "Post name").'
				* Style: Using double quotes rather than single quotes.
				* Name: WordPress has changed "postname" to "Post name".
			* "This means we can't output the sitemap through the WordPress rewrite rules."
				* Now is: "This means the robots.txt file can't be outputted through the WordPress rewrite rules."
				* Updated: We can now output sitemap.xml, but it's impossible (by robots specification) to output the robots.txt file.
				* Anthropomorphism: We shouldn't use "we", it's an integrated and automated "it" system.
					* More updates like this will follow in the future.

* **For developers:**
	* **Added:**
		* Method `is_sitemap()`, determines whether the request is rendering the sitemap output of The SEO Framework.
		* Method `is_robots()`, a copy of WordPress' Core function `is_robots()`.
		* Method `get_plugin_indicator()`, it returns the plugin output indication, so they can be used in custom scenarios (like AMP).
		* Method `get_sitemap_xml_url()`, it returns the correct URL in any situation.
		* Method `get_robots_txt_url()`, it returns the correct URL in any situation.
	* **Changed:**
		* Method `get_home_host()`:
			1. It now uses function `get_home_url()`, rather than `get_option( 'home' )`.
			2. It now adds ports, if any (likely found on local development environments).
		* (Typo) Renamed method `get_relatitve_fontcolor` to `get_relative_fontcolor`.
			* No fallback (backwards compatible) method has been put in place. A warning is displayed instead.
	* **Improved:**
		* Method `add_menu_link()` can now be called multiple times without issues.
		* Method `get_all_options()` now has an extra method parameter that allows to overwrite the cache.
		* Incorporated WordPress Core filter `get_the_archive_title` in method `get_the_real_archive_title()`.
			* This method is a copy of WordPress function `get_the_archive_title()` with admin capabilities.
		* Method `get_sitemap_xsl_url()`, it now returns the correct URL in any situation.
		* Method `can_do_sitemap_robots()` now also checks for permalink settings.
		* The Markdown URL parser now adds `nofollow noopener noreferrer`, rather than only `nofollow`.
			* This unbinds threads in Chromium, for enhanced performance and debatable security.
	* **Updated:**
		* Extended file copyrights by a year. Awesome.
	* **Removed:**
		* Functions that were deprecated since version 2.7.0; therefore, the `inc/functions/deprecated.php` file could and has been unloaded.
	* **Filter notes:**
		* **Added:**
			* (array) `the_seo_framework_generated_description_additions`, this filters the generated description additions.
				* See [this post for more information](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-translate-on-in-meta-description/#post-9107717).
		* **Fixed:**
			* `the_seo_framework_description_args` second parameter now works.
			* `the_seo_framework_og_image_args` second parameter now works.
			* `the_seo_framework_title_args` second parameter now works.
			* `the_seo_framework_url_args` second parameter now works.

**Detailed log:**

***TODO thingy***

= 2.9.1 - Sovereign Comprehension =

**Release date:**

* March 27th, 2017

**Summarized:**

* This release patches a few bugs that were brought with the 2.9.0 release related to debugging and cache clearing.

**Detailed log:**

***All we have to decide is what to do with [the time that is given us](https://theseoframework.com/?p=1912#detailed)***

= 2.9.0 - Equitable Erudition =

*Courage is found in unlikely places - J.R.R. Tolkien*

**Release date:**

* March 25th, 2017

**Summarized:**

* This update focuses on fixing bugs and expanding the API for developers.
* To expand the API for per page (in-post) SEO settings, tabs had to be added in the SEO settings meta box.
* The JavaScript code has also been overhauled to improve performance and allow third party implementation.
* Moreover, the home page settings now allow you to upload a social image.
* Structured data markup has also been improved, like the inclusion of an alternative Sitename and fixes for Breadcrumb images.
* The sitemap can now include the blog page. The lastmod value of which listens to multiple pages to automatically determines what's best.
* Unfortunately, Twitter has removed support for photo cards. This update makes sure that the regarding settings correctly convert to the current format.

**Only one week left for the earliest of early-bird discounts:**

* With [The SEO Framework - Extension Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-extension-manager/)'s release, a celebratory discount has been introduced.
* If you wish to benefit from this lifetime discount, [visit the shop](https://premium.theseoframework.com/shop/) for more information.
* More awesome extensions are coming soon!

**Survey:**

* After updating, please fill in our [Update Survey](https://theseoframework.com/?p=1781): tell us what you like or can be done better.

**For everyone: Tabbed In-post SEO layout**

* This release brings tabbed layout to the in-post SEO settings.
* With this change I've also altered the overall looks, with the help from [Daniel](https://github.com/danielpost).
* This layout allows extensions from the [Extension Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-seo-framework-extension-manager/) to be implemented much easier.
* This layout is self-responsive! This means it's not dependent on the browser size, but on how much content will fit.
* Therefore, this layout allows the SEO settings to be placed in the right sidebar! Take a look at the [new screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/#screenshots).

**For everyone: Browser support**

* This release brings [CSS Flexbox](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/) to the new in-post SEO settings meta box.
* The flexbox module is still experimental, in a way that not all browsers correctly support this to the fullest extend.
* However, support for as many browsers feasible has been implemented. Check out [the list](https://theseoframework.com/?p=1903#browser-support). Enjoy!
* The gist is that Chrome, Firefox, IE10 and Safari 6 or later are supported.

**SEO Tip of the Update - Trust in layout**

* Is your website glitchy and has placeholder images, unmatched colors or weirdly contrasting borders all over the place?
* Consider going for a more modern and clean layout. Strip out what isn't necessary. A clean layout implies professionalism and increases visitors' trust.
* Even if you're just starting out with your website, remove all that could be but really isn't. Because if you leave in placeholders for the future, it implies amateurism.
* People want their truth to be confirmed or their problems to be solved. If you can't confirm or solve the layout of your website, then they won't trust you to do so for their issues.
* Simply put: It doesn't have to be perfect, it just must be done.
