*Read [this guide](https://theseoframework.com/docs/seo-data-migration/) for transferring SEO Content using SEO Data Transporter.

= Unbranded, Free and for the Professional =
This plugin is unbranded! This even means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within the WordPress interface, aside from the plugin activation page.
This plugin makes great use of the default WordPress interface elements, like as if this plugin is part of WordPress. No ads, no nags.
The small and hidden HTML comment can easily be disabled with the use of a filter.

Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your or someone else's website. A clean interface, for everyone.

= Numbers don't lie, performance matters =
Optimizing SEO is a fundamental process for any website. So we try to be non-intrusive with The SEO Framework.
The SEO Framework is byte and process optimized on PHP level, with each update the optimization is improved when possible.
Page rendering time matters in SEO. This is where we lay focus on.

* This plugin is written with massive and busy (multi-)sites in mind.
* This plugin uses various caching methods which store heavy calculations in memory and the database.
* This plugin is on average 1.49x to 1.95x faster compared to other popular SEO plugins.
* This plugin consumes on average 1.42x more server resources than other popular SEO plugins in exchange for improved performance.
* This plugin has on average 1.30 to 1.60x more database interactions in exchange for improved performance.
* And last but not least, this plugin always has 100% fewer advertisements. Let's keep it that way.

*Numbers may vary per installation and version. Last checked: 14th May 2016.*
*The numbers are based on actual plugin code runtime.*

= Completely pluggable =
The SEO Framework also features pluggable functions. All functions are active and can be called within the WordPress Loop.
This allows other developers to extend the plugin wherever needed.
We have also provided an API documentation located at [The SEO Framework API Docs](http://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

**This plugin helps you to create better content, at a glance. By showing you:**

* If the title is too long, too short, duplicated, and/or automatically generated.
* If the description is too long, too short, duplicated, has too many repeated words and/or automatically generated.
* If the page is indexed, redirected, followed and/or archived, while looking at other WordPress settings.

**We call this The SEO Bar. Check out the [Screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/screenshots/#plugin-info) to see how it helps you!**

= Still not convinced? Let's dive deeper =

**By default, this plugin automatically generates:**

* Title, with super-fast 'wrong themes' support.
* Description, with anti-spam techniques.
* A canonical URL.
* Various Open Graph, Facebook and Twitter tags.
* Special Open Graph description, which organically integrates with the Facebook and Twitter snippets.
* Extended Open Graph Images support, including image manipulation.
* Canonical, with full WPMUdev Domain Mapping, subdomain and HTTPS support to prevent duplicated content.
* Schema.org LD+Json script that adds extended search support for Google Search and Chrome.
* Schema.org LD+Json script for Knowledge Graph (Personal/Business site relations, name and logo).
* Advanced Schema.org LD+Json script for Breadcrumbs (just like the visual one) which extends page relation support in Google Search.
* Schema.org LD+Json script to show the correct site name in Google Breadcrumbs.
* Publishing and editing dates, accurate to the day.
* Link relationships, with full WPMUdev Domain Mapping and HTTPS support.
* Simple Sitemap with Pages, Posts and Custom Post Types (CPT), which listens to the in-post settings.
* Feed excerpts and backlinks to prevent content scraping.

**This plugin goes further, behind the screens it:**

* Prevents canonical errors with categories, pages, subdomains and Multisite Domain Mapping.
* Disables 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even if they don't send a 404 response.
* Automatically notifies Google, Bing and Yandex on Post or Page update and deletion when sitemaps are enabled.

**This plugin allows you to manually set various values for each post, page, public CPT and term.**

**This plugin allows you to adjust over 90 site settings, including:**

* Title and Description Separators and additions.
* Automated description output.
* Schema.org output, including Knowledge Graph options.
* Various robots options.
* Many home page specific options.
* Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest social integration
* Shortlink tag output.
* Link relationships
* Google, Bing, Pinterest and Yandex Webmaster verification
* Sitemap integration.
* Robots.txt sitemap integration.
* Feed anti-scraper options.
* And many, many more settings.

> This plugin is fully compatible with the [Domain Mapping plugin by WPMUdev](https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/domain-mapping/) and the [Domain Mapping plugin by Donncha](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-mu-domain-mapping/).<br>
> This compatibility ensures **prevention of canonical errors**. This way your site will always be correctly indexed, no matter what you use!<br>

= Caching =

This plugin's code is highly optimized on PHP-level and uses variable, object and transient caching. This means that there's little extra page load time from this plugin, even with more Meta tags used.
A caching plugin isn't even needed for this plugin as you won't notice a difference, however it's supported wherever best suited.

= Compatibility =

* Full internationalization support through WordPress.org.
* Extended Multibyte support (CJK).
* Full Right to Left (RTL) language support.
* Extended Color vision deficiency accessibility.
* Screen reader accessibility.
* MultiSite, this plugin is in fact built upon one.
* Detection of robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.
* Detection of theme Title output "doing it right" (or wrong).
* Automatic detection of various other popular SEO tools.

**If you have other popular SEO plugins activated, this plugin will automatically prevent SEO mistakes by deactivating itself on almost every part.**

= About the Sitemap =

The Sitemap generated with The SEO Framework is sufficient for Search Engines to find Posts, Pages and supported Custom Post Types throughout your website.
It also listens to the noindex settings on each of the items.
If you however require a more expanded Sitemap, feel free to activate a dedicated Sitemap plugin. The SEO Framework will automatically deactivate its Sitemap functionality when another (known) Sitemap plugin is found.
If it is not automatically detected and no notification has been provided on the Sitemap Settings, feel free to open a support ticket and it will be addressed carefully.

The Breadcrumb script generated by this plugin on Posts will also make sure Google easily finds related categories which aren't included within the Sitemap of this plugin.

= Other notes =

*Genesis SEO will be disabled upon activating this plugin. This plugin takes over and extends Genesis SEO.*

***The Automatic Description Generation will work with any installation, but it will exclude shortcodes. This means that if you use shortcodes or a page builder, be sure to enter your custom description or the description will fall short.***

***The home page tagline settings won't have any effect on the title output if your theme's title output is not written according to the WordPress standards, which luckily are enforced strongly on new WordPress.org themes since recently.***

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework Free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads or nags!

= I have a feature request, I've found a bug, a plugin is incompatible... =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell me about it. I try to get back to you within 48 hours. :)

= Is this really a Framework? =

This plugin is not in particular a framework in a technical sense, but it is built with a framework's mindset. It is however a framework for your website's SEO, a building block that keeps everything together.
This means that this plugin will do all the great Search Engine Optimization, and also allows for extensions and real-time alterations. For when you really want or need to change something.
Extensions built for this plugin might just as well work as a standalone. The SEO Framework provides an easier and cached way of doing so, however.

= I am a developer, how can I help? =

The SEO Framework is currently a one-man project. However, any input is greatly appreciated and everything will be considered.
Please leave feature requests in the Support Forums and I will talk you through the process of implementing it if necessary.

= I'm not a developer, how can I help? =

A way of donating is available through the donation link on the plugin website.
However, you can also greatly help by telling your friends about this plugin :).

= I want to remove or change stuff, but I can't find an option! =

The SEO Framework is very pluggable on many fields. Please refer to the [Other Notes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/other_notes/).
Please note that a free plugin is underway which will allow you to change all filters from the dashboard. No ETA yet.

= Does this plugin collect my data? =

Absolutely not! Read more about this on the [Plugin Guidelines, Section 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/).

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, news, etc. is this OK? =

This is not a problem. Search Engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.
If a visitor can't find a page, why would a Search Engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's usability.

= What's does the application/ld+json script do? =

The LD+Json scripts are Search Engine helpers which tell Search Engines how to connect and index the site. They tell the Search Engine if your site contains an internal search engine, what sites you're socially connected to and what page structure you're using.

= The meta data is not being updated, and I'm using a caching plugin. =

All The SEO Framework's metadata is put into Object cache when a caching plugin is available. The descriptions and schema.org scripts are put into Transients. Please be sure to clear your cache.
If you're using W3 Total Cache you might be interested in [this free plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3tc-auto-pilot/) to do it for you.

= Ugh, I don't want anyone to know I'm using The SEO Framework! =

Aww :(
Oh well, here's the filter you need to remove the HTML tags saying where the Meta tags are coming from:
`add_filter( 'the_seo_framework_indicator', '__return_false' );`

= I'm fine with The SEO Framework, but not with you! =

Well then! D: We got off on the wrong foot, I guess..
If you wish to remove "by Sybre Waaijer" from your HTML code, here's the filter:
`add_filter( 'sybre_waaijer_<3', '__return_false' );`

= I want to transport SEO data from other plugins to The SEO Framework, how do I do this? =

Please refer to this small guide: [SEO Data Migration](http://theseoframework.com/docs/seo-data-migration/).
Transporting Terms and Taxonomies SEO data isn't supported.

== Changelog ==

**Release date:**
/

** Summarized:**
/
* As the Extension Manager is on its way, it's the first time I actually need to make use of this plugin's application framework.
* With this, I noticed some things are to be improved. And with this update, a lot has been. As this is an Open Source project, the source sometimes needs a little change too.
* This is a maintenance release, and although nothing noticable has been changed, added or fixed; however, this update makes everything a lot lighter on your server.
* For developers, the code has been cleaned up again, massively. Enjoy!
* For everyone, this plugin now makes use of the WordPress core term data handling. Making this plugin much more reliable, and 30% faster (according to xDebug) TODO is expected BENCHMARK to see real results.

	* TODO
**Improved:**
	/
	* TODO
	* Dismissible notices are now dismissible on every admin page when called.
**Changed:**
	/

**Updated:**
	/
	* TODO
	* TODO POT translation file.
	* TODO The settings metaboxes order has been reset. This ensures that the General Settings are shown first after updating. (Unless you've filtered it? TODO confirm)
**Fixed:**
	/
	* TODO

	* TODO When updating the plugin, without added options, the update notification now really should no longer show up. ^related

**For developers:**
/
TODO
**Added:**
	/
	* TODO
**Improved:**
	/
	* Class contents `AutoDescription_Query` are now reworked to be much more effecient and predictable.
	* Methods within `AutoDescription_Query` have been re-evaluated whether they use the WordPress query cache. If that holds true, the query object cache has been omitted from the said method.
	* Improved plugin memory usage by 16%. TODO confirm again on release version.
**Changed:**
	/
	* 'AutoDescription_Siteoptions::page_id' is now publicly accessible. Making it easier to add submenu items.
	* All class `AutoDescription_Metaboxes` metabox output function parameters have been shifted by one. The first parameter is now used for the (unavailable) post object. The second must be an array. This change affects the following methods:
		* `AutoDescription_Metaboxes::title_metabox`
		* `AutoDescription_Metaboxes::description_metabox`
		* `AutoDescription_Metaboxes::homepage_metabox`
		* `AutoDescription_Metaboxes::social_metabox`
		* `AutoDescription_Metaboxes::knowledge_metabox`
		* `AutoDescription_Metaboxes::schema_metabox`
		* `AutoDescription_Metaboxes::robots_metabox`

		* `AutoDescription_Metaboxes::sitemaps_metabox`
		* `AutoDescription_Metaboxes::feed_metabox`
	* All class `AutoDescription_Metaboxes` metabox output functions have been put into "views". These view files are included upon calling them. The files that are attached can only be used within the plugin scope. This massively reduces the plugin memory overhead.
**Fixed:**
	/
	* Function `the_seo_framework_dot_version()` now works as intended.
	* Method `AutoDescription_Query::is_single()` first parameter can now be an array without crashing the site.
**Removed:**
	/
	* Unused network admin methods. Network admin settings constants and filters are held intact for the future. The related changes are listed below.
		* Method `AutoDescription_Adminpages::add_network_menu_link()`, without deprecation.
		* Method `AutoDescription_Adminpages::network_admin()`, without deprecation.
		* Public var `AutoDescription_Adminpages::network_pagehook`, without deprecation.
