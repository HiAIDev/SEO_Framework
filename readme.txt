= Unbranded, Free and for the Professional =
This plugin is unbranded! This means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within the WordPress interface, aside from the plugin activation page.
This plugin makes great use of the default WordPress interface elements, like as if this plugin is part of WordPress. No ads, no nags.
The small and hidden HTML comment can easily be disabled with the use of a filter or extension.

Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your or someone else's website. A clean interface, for everyone.

= Completely automated =
**By default, this plugin automatically generates:**

* Title, with super-fast 'wrong themes' support.
* Description, with anti-spam techniques.
* A canonical URL, with full WPMUdev Domain Mapping, subdomain and HTTPS support to prevent duplicated content.
* Various Open Graph, Facebook and Twitter tags.
* Special Open Graph description, which organically integrates with the Facebook and Twitter snippets.
* Extended Open Graph Images support, including automated image manipulation.
* Schema.org LD+Json script that adds extended search support for Google Search and Chrome.
* Schema.org LD+Json script for Knowledge Graph (Personal/Business site relations, name and logo).
* Advanced Schema.org LD+Json script for Breadcrumbs (just like the visual one) which extends page relation support in Google Search.
* Schema.org LD+Json script to show the correct site name in Google Breadcrumbs.
* Publishing and editing dates, accurate to the day.
* Link relationships, with full WPMUdev Domain Mapping and HTTPS support.
* Simple Sitemap with Pages, Posts and Custom Post Types (CPT), which listens to the in-post settings.
* Feed excerpts and backlinks to prevent content scraping.

**This plugin goes further, behind the screens it:**

* Prevents canonical errors with categories, pages, subdomains and Multisite Domain Mapping.
* Disables 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even if they don't send a 404 response.
* Automatically notifies Google, Bing and Yandex on Post or Page update and deletion when sitemaps are enabled.

= Generously personal =
**This plugin allows you to manually set various values for each post, page, public CPT and term.**

**This plugin allows you to adjust over 90 site settings, including:**

* Title and Description Separators and additions.
* Automated description output.
* Schema.org output, including Knowledge Graph options.
* Various robots' options.
* Many home page specific options.
* Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest social integration
* Shortlink tag output.
* Link relationships
* Google, Bing, Pinterest and Yandex Webmaster verification
* Sitemap integration.
* Robots.txt sitemap integration.
* Feed anti-scraper options.
* And many, many more settings.

= Openly pluggable =
The SEO Framework has been built to go further than just itself.
Take a look at the API documentation located at [The SEO Framework API Docs](http://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= The SEO Bar =
**This plugin helps you to create better content, at a glance. By showing you:**

* If the title is too long, too short, duplicated, and/or automatically generated.
* If the description is too long, too short, duplicated, has too many repeated words and/or automatically generated.
* If the page is indexed, redirected, followed and/or archived, while looking at other WordPress settings.

**We call this The SEO Bar. Check out the [Screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/screenshots/#plugin-info) to see how it helps you!**

> This plugin is fully compatible with the [Domain Mapping plugin by WPMUdev](https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/domain-mapping/) and the [Domain Mapping plugin by Donncha](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-mu-domain-mapping/).<br>
> This compatibility ensures **prevention of canonical errors**. This way your site will always be correctly indexed, no matter what you use!<br>

= Hardcore caching =
This plugin's code is highly optimized on PHP-level and uses variable, object and transient caching. This means that there's little extra page load time from this plugin, even with more Meta tags used.
A caching plugin isn't even needed for this plugin as you won't notice a difference, however it's supported wherever best suited.

= Compatibility =

* Full internationalization support through WordPress.org.
* Extended Multibyte support (CJK).
* Full Right to Left (RTL) language support.
* Extended Color vision deficiency accessibility.
* Screen reader accessibility.
* MultiSite, this plugin is in fact built upon one.
* Detection of robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.
* Detection of theme Title output "doing it right" (or wrong).
* Automatic detection of various other popular SEO tools.

**If you have other popular SEO plugins activated, this plugin will automatically prevent SEO mistakes by deactivating itself on almost every part.**

= An additional sitemap =
The Sitemap generated with The SEO Framework is sufficient for Search Engines to find Posts, Pages and supported Custom Post Types throughout your website.
It also listens to the noindex settings on each of the items.
If you however require a more expanded Sitemap, feel free to activate a dedicated Sitemap plugin. The SEO Framework will automatically deactivate its Sitemap functionality when another (known) Sitemap plugin is found.
If it is not automatically detected and no notification has been provided on the Sitemap Settings, feel free to open a support ticket and it will be addressed carefully.

= Hidden breadcrumbs =
The Breadcrumb script generated by this plugin on Posts will also make sure Google easily finds related categories which aren't included within the Sitemap of this plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Install The SEO Framework either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.
1. Either Network Activate this plugin or activate it on a single site.
1. That's it!
1. Let the plugin automatically work or fine-tune each page with the metaboxes beneath the content or on the taxonomy pages.
1. Adjust the SEO settings through the SEO settings page if desired. Red checkboxes are rather left unchecked. Green checkboxes are default enabled.

== Screenshots ==

1. This plugin shows you what you can improve, at a glance. With full color vision deficiency support.
2. Hover over any of the SEO Bar's items to see how you can improve the page's SEO. Red is bad, orange is okay, green is good. Blue is situational.
3. The dynamic Post/Page SEO settings Metabox. This box is also neatly implemented in Categories and Tags.
4. The SEO Settings Page. With over 90 settings, you are in full control. Using the Default Settings and filling in the Knowledge Graph Settings and Social Meta Settings is recommended to do.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework Free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads or nags!

= I have a feature request, I've found a bug, a plugin is incompatible... =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell me about it. I try to get back to you within 48 hours. :)

= Is this really a Framework? =

This plugin is not in particular a framework in a technical sense, but it is built with a framework's mindset. It is however a framework for your website's SEO, a building block that keeps everything together.
This means that this plugin will do all the great Search Engine Optimization, and also allows for extensions and real-time alterations. For when you really want or need to change something.
Extensions built for this plugin might just as well work as a standalone. The SEO Framework provides an easier and cached way of doing so, however.

= I am a developer; how can I help? =

The SEO Framework is currently a one-man project. However, any input is greatly appreciated and everything will be considered.
Please leave feature requests in the Support Forums and I will talk you through the process of implementing it if necessary.

= I want to remove or change stuff, but I can't find an option! =

The SEO Framework is very pluggable on many fields. Please refer to the [Other Notes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/other_notes/).
Please note that a free plugin is underway which will allow you to change all filters from the dashboard. No ETA yet.

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, news, etc. is this OK? =

This is not an issue. Search Engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.
If a visitor can't find a page, then why would a Search Engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's usability.

= What's does the application/ld+json script do? =

The LD+Json scripts are Search Engine helpers which tell Search Engines how to connect and index the site. They tell the Search Engine if your site contains an internal search engine, what sites you're socially connected to and what page structure you're using.

= The meta data is not being updated, and I'm using a caching plugin. =

All The SEO Framework's metadata is put into Object cache when a caching plugin is available. The descriptions and Schema.org scripts are put into Transients. Please be sure to clear your cache.

= I want to transport SEO data from other plugins to The SEO Framework, how do I do this? =

Please refer to this small guide: [SEO Data Migration](http://theseoframework.com/docs/seo-data-migration/).
Transporting Terms and Taxonomies SEO data isn't supported.

== Changelog ==

= 2.8.0 - ??? (John F. Nash Jr. reference?) =

**Release date:**

* PLANNED: January 2017 ?

**Important Note:**

* PHP 5.2 hasn't recieved updates for [over 5 years](http://php.net/eol.php) and using it is a major security risk.
* **This maintenance release completely drops support for PHP 5.2**. So, if you're using PHP 5.2, from this version on you can no longer run The SEO Framework.
* PHP 5.2 is a practicality and convinience hindrance for developers and is also source for bugs. Sometimes, we have to split otherwise simple code over multiple lines just to support it.
* WordPress is about to drop support for PHP 5.2 as well in the near future. See proposed [trac ticket 36335](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36335).
* Inform your host to keep updated! Read more about informing your host [here](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/). If they decline, I'd urge you to switch hosts for your website's sake.

***This update drops support for WordPress 4.3.x, the minimum required version for The SEO Framework now is WordPress 4.4.***

**Summarized:**

* This major release not only fixes various bugs, but also introduces new options for you to fiddle with.
* You're now able to adjust General Settings easily! These settings include options to adjust the cache, (re)move the SEO Bar, and set a Canonical Scheme.
* Google's Knowledge Graph has been transformed into something much bigger last year, so the related settings now fall under a new name: "Authorized Presence".
* You can now more granularly control your website's social images. With this much asked for feature, you're now really in control.

**New enhancements overview:**
/
* TODO

**SEO tip of the Update:**

* Not all SEO techniques are actively used on Google outside of the United States.
* For example, the Site Name Schema.org script might not have any effect.
* This changes over time as Google updates its Search Engine all over the world.
* Usage of experimental Schema.org scripts cause no harm to ranking.

***Are you an avid developer, and have extended The SEO Framework? Please carefully read the detailed changelog, or at least compare it to your implementations. All method, function, action and filter changes are listed there.***
*In essence, if you've programmed as described within the API, no changes should be made.*

**Detailed log:**
/
***What is work without [innovation](https://theseoframework.com/?p= TODO #detailed)?***

**For everyone:**

* **Added:**
	/
	* TODO Social image fallback selection.
	* Added Social Image URL for Posts upload.
		* This image can get manually resized and cropped on upload to abide to Facebook's Open Graph standards.
			* This resizer shows you Facebook's prefered dimensions by default.
			* This resizer always crops the images in order to have a maximum size of 1500px width/height.
		* This image is used for Facebook (Open Graph) and Twitter and has the highest priority of output, over other found images.
		* This image also works on custom post types.
		* There's a built-in feature that prevents duplicated output with WooCommerce gallery images. Enjoy!
	* The Authorized Presence (Knowledge Graph) now outputs its script regardless of social sites being filled in. This means that the logo is always used, if present, and that the organization/person type and name will always be highlighted.
	* [Google's Social Profile Links](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/social-profile-links), this is the same as the previously named "Knowledge Graph"; but that brand has been expanded to cover more grounds.
		* These settings have been moved to the Schema metabox. The Schema settings cover the [Knowledge Graph](https://www.google.com/intl/bn/insidesearch/features/search/knowledge.html).
	* Site Logo detection! Brought to you in WordPress 4.5.
		* Only when the theme supports it. You can upload one through the customizer (Site Identity).
			* You'll also be notified on its support at the Schema Settings metabox "Presence" tab.
		* This allows for a new fallback image! This one has priority over the Site Icon.
		* The Knowledge Graph makes good use of this logo, it has priority over the Site Icon.
	* A new General settings metabox! Containing:
		* General Settings. Generalized general general settings, commander:
			/
			* TODO This tab still needs to be filled in. So it's hidden for now.
		* Performance Settings.
			* Transient cache settings:
				* You might wish to adjust these settings, if:
					* You use object caching. The whole SEO output is stored in object cache for each page.
					* You use page caching. The whole SEO output is then stored within the page cache already.
					* Unlikely, your website's PHP engine and database are extremely optimized. Disabling the options might even improve performance.
					* You have thousands of pages and posts. Disabling these options will desaturate the database over time, which might improve performance.
			* Object cache settings:
				* Only available when an object caching plugin has been detected (and it's turned on).
				* You might wish to disable the description and Schema.org transient caches if this is in effect.
					* These caches are leveled inside the object cache. However, these caches can be used elsewhere, like in the SEO Bar.
			* Did you know that you can view the SEO meta generation time within the page's source?
		* Layout settings. You might want to take a look at these settings, if:
			* You don't need or even dislike the SEO Bar.
			* You want to adjust visual impairment settings. ?? This is already possible (although hidden), slightly redundant.
		* Canonical settings. You should only change these settings, if:
			* Your website is accessible through both HTTP and HTTPS
			* Link relationship settings have been put here.
	* A visual notification for when an actual `robots.txt` file has been found has been put in place in the Sitemap Settings metabox.
		* This makes the Robots tab visible once more.
	* A visual notification of the sitemap's whereabouts has been put in place in the Sitemap Settings metabox when a sitemap.xml file has been detected.
	* This plugin now tests PHP and WordPress compatibility. In the admin screens you'll be notified on why the plugin fails to work after you activate or update the plugin.
		* If everything goes correctly, it'll be a smooth upgrade. Enjoy!
	* Improved object cache plugin support. These settings can be found in the General Settings metabox on the SEO Settings page.
	/
	* Added stylesheet to sitemap. Now your sitemap looks much more professional.
		* It's so professional, even the stylesheet URL is masked.
		* It's a virtual file, just like the sitemap is. Enjoy!
* **Changed:**
	* "Knowledge Graph" name has been converted into "Authorized Presence". Its usage, output and effect are still the same.
	* The first two description separator buttons are no longer marked "recommended".
		* This is because the description tag is less prominently used and does not need to support old browsers or old screen readers.
	* The sitemap rewrite rules and transient no longer flush when just hitting "save settings" on the SEO Settings page.
		* You now have to actually change an option.
		* This also limits pinging to search engines. So they won't be notified anymore when nothing has changed.
* **Improved:**
	* When the description title additions exceed 72 characters, they will no longer be included in the automated description.
		* This is also documented as a fix, but it states 154 characters instead of 72 there.
		* This should reduce the chance of spamdexing by keyword spamming.
		* This change is completely in line with Google's automated description guidelines. See "[Create good meta description](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35624#1)" (heading "Programmatically generate descriptions").
	/
	* Object cache is no longer initiated on each page when no Object Caching plugin has been detected.
	* The post/page/term object cache is now flushed on edit/save.
	* The accessible counter type (with background color, type 1) is now a bit bolder.
	* On Woocommerce list tables additional tabs injected by other plugins will likely not overflow anymore.
	* The sitemap cache now supports multiple languages. This means more than one sitemap can be created.
	* Removed redundant and duplicated checks on the Open Graph image generation.
	* Method `the_seo_framework()->generate_title()`, `the_seo_framework()->get_notagline_title()` and `the_seo_framework()->title()` with `$args['page_on_front']` now supports outputting the Home Page title, instead of "Untitled".
	* All of the post meta is now sanitized before inserted in the databse.
		* This is not a security improvement per se, but rather a consistency improvement so you know what the output will be.
		* Added sanitation:
			* One/zero for all checkboxes.
			* Canonical URL is now cleaned, query parameters are no longer allowed:
				1. They are a source of bugs, not every developer considers them at all times.
				1. Google doesn't like them, they can also be seen as spam.
				1. You shouldn't be using them anyway in a stable WordPress environment.
					* WordPress has an awesome feature called the Rewrite API.
				1. They are very confusing for the end-user.
					* They also disturb engagement for trust. Clean URLs are always preferred.
			* The rest is unchanged.
	/
	* TODO When focussing on a field which is showing a placeholder, the placeholder is now blurred.
	* TODO The sitename set in "Organization or Personal Name" is now used consistently throughout the Schema.org output settings.
	* Description and schema transient cache is no longer initiated on Search Pages.
	* TODO Header, Site Icon and Site Logo images are now downsized if the image is exceeding 1500px in either height or width (or both).
	* When settings are reset, the notification won't show up again when refreshing the page.
	* The sitemap schemas are now more clearly defined for Search Engines and validators.
	* The description example field now better reflects the actual output.
	* The admin JS file is now much smaller (~30%) and includes several performance optimizations.
* **Updated:**
	/
	* TODO Translation POT file.
	* TODO All previous Schema.org output transients have been invalidated. TODO.. note below next entry
	* All previous automated description transients have been invalidated.
		* Old caches will automatically be cleaned from the database.
		* New caches will automatically be set up. This might cause a small performance hit after the update, which should automatically be resolved.
	* Upon updating this plugin, the old term metadata (The SEO Framework 2.6.6 and lower) will be removed.
		* If you've upgraded from version 2.6.6 or below to this version (or any later version), it will first make sure the old metadata is transferred correctly.
* **Removed:**
	/
	* Knowledge Graph Settings metabox.
		* Its content has been moved inside the Schema Settings metabox under the "General" and "Presence" tabs.
	/
	* Link Relationship Settings within the Social Meta Settings metabox.
	 	* Its content has been moved to the General Settings metabox in the Canonical tab.
	* WordPress 4.3.x support has been dropped. This plugin now requires WordPress 4.4 or later.
	* WordPress 4.3.x and lower backwards compatibility functions have been removed.
* **Fixed:**
	/
	* TODO On some themes, a fatal error was output when editing posts. (requires confirmation)
		* https://wordpress.org/support/topic/can-not-edit-post-after-v2-7-0-update/
	/
	* TODO Page and post excerpts now correctly work.
		* https://wordpress.org/support/topic/excerpt-to-meta-description-issue-screencast/
	/
	* TODO On some themes, the private prefix has been added to the title (already fixed, requires confirmation)
		* https://wordpress.org/support/topic/category-page-title-with-weird-unwanted-prefix/
	/
	* TODO With PolyLang, the canonical URL failed to write the language path on the home pages.
		* https://wordpress.org/support/topic/polylang-canonicals-failing-on-homepage/
	/
	* When the title exceeds 154 characters, the description will no longer contain the complete post's content. Instead, the title will now be omitted and the description length has been limited to 155 characters.
	* WPML sitemap generated URL path now reflects the language. TODO confirm.
	* TODO WPML Home Page post meta is now correctly fetched.
		* https://wordpress.org/support/topic/seo-framework-breaks-geodirectory/ (topic title doesn't reflect complete subject)
	/
	* TODO Robots.txt settings outputted incorrect notice when site is blocked from robots through WordPress reading settings while the sitemap has been deactivated.
	* TODO bbPress forum topic ID's weren't correctly recognized. With this fix, these issues have been resolved:
		- TODO The title is now correct.
		- TODO The description is now correct.
		- TODO The canonical URL is now correct.
	/
	* TODO AnsPress category canonical URL is now correct on its categories. @link https://wordpress.org/support/topic/anspress-categories/
	* TODO The SEO Bar's on-hover tooltip is now once more correctly visible on mobile devices.
	* TODO The notification that's displayed when settings are reset is no longer displayed on refresh.
	* The website's tagline is no longer shown in the description when no excerpt can be generated.
	* The counter type now correctly updates for new user meta created after The SEO Framework 2.7.0+ is installed.
	* TODO SEO Settings tabs now correctly show the tab's content when hitting the "back" button.
		* This behavior is caused because browsers save form data when travelling through history. Tabs are self-contained button forms for improved performance.
	/
	* TODO When enabling the option "Remove Blogname from title?", the blogname is removed too from manual SEO title entries.

**For translators:**

**This part of the changelog is quite redundant and reluctant in its data; nevertheless, the gist is: new translations are ready!**

* **Added:**
	* Quite a lot of new sentences, because two metaboxes got merged, and a new one arose.
	* A markdown parser has been added to the plugin. This will be used for future translations.
		* Some strings already use this.
* **Changed:**
	* Many sentences have changed, in order to better reflect the option usages.
	* A few sentences have been updated slightly in order to be sanitized correctly.
* **Fixed:**
	* One sentence wasn't annotated correctly.
* **Removed:**
	* Some sentences.
	* Almost all debugging sentences.

**For developers:**

**Methods are no longer annotated by their classname in the changelog; instead they're now annotated with the object `the_seo_framework()->`**.
**All methods are treated as final, this means no duplicated method names should exist within the object. Except for magic methods, like `__construct()`.**

* **Added:**
	* All classes and many functions are now converted to use namespaces.
		* Package and Namespace: `The_SEO_Framework`
	* `\The_SEO_Framework\Load->__set()` magic method.
		* This prevents inaccessible property writing.
		* This allows for property deprecation handling.
		* A warning is emited whenever this method is accessed.
	* Class autoloading.
		* Now all The SEO Framework class files are required when needed, automatically.
	* New JavaScript l10n and object property: 'hasInput'. Determines if the page renders The SEO Framework's input boxes, to be used to improve performance.
	* Method `the_seo_framework()->s_excerpt()`. For escaping and prettifying (description) excerpts with consideration of shortcodes through filters.
		* This method was extracted from `the_seo_framework()->get_excerpt_by_id()` when solely using the first parameter.
	* Most sanitation functions are now public. This allows for easier, predictable and more secure external code.
	* Two new description methods:
		1. `the_seo_framework()->get_description_excerpt_normal()`, fetches the normal description excerpt.
		1. `the_seo_framework()->get_description_excerpt_social()`, fetches the social description excerpt.
	* New secure `the_seo_framework()->convert_markdown()` method. To be used to ease up translation strings in the future (and past).
	* New post meta additions: `_social_image_url` and `_social_image_id`.
		* The latter is JS only, as it requires WordPress' image editor.
* **Changed:**
	* **IMPORTANT:** All the classes can't be initiated directly anymore. Always use `the_seo_framework()`.
		* Failing to do so will result in a fatal error.
		* This allows me (the developer) to easily change the class structure without compatibility issues in the future.
	* All classes have been renamed.
		* They are now preceded by `\The_SEO_Framework\`, in accordance to their newly acquired namespace.
		* For example, class `AutoDescription_Feed` is now `\The_SEO_Framework\Feed`.
	* Most core functions have been renamed.
		* They now use a namespace.
		* Affected functions:
			* `the_seo_framework_upgrade()` is now `\The_SEO_Framework\_init_upgrade()` and is now marked private.
			* `the_seo_framework_init()` is now `\The_SEO_Framework\_init()` and is now marked private. Use `the_seo_framework()` instead.
			* `the_seo_framework_load()` is now `\The_SEO_Framework\_can_load()` and is now marked private. Use `the_seo_framework_active()` instead.
			* `the_seo_framework_flush_rewrite_rules_deactivation()` is now `\The_SEO_Framework\_deactivation()` and is now marked private.
			* `the_seo_framework_flush_rewrite_rules_activation()` is now `\The_SEO_Framework\_activation()` and is now marked private.
			* `the_seo_framework_locale_init()` is now `\The_SEO_Framework\_init_locale()` and is now marked private.
	* The main class `The_SEO_Framework\Load` can not be initiated twice anymore. Failing to do so will return `null`.
		* Always use function `the_seo_framework()` if you wish to access a method or property.
	* Some class files have been moved.
		* The changes:
			* The main class file `load.class.php` has been moved to the `/autodescription/inc/classes/` folder, from the `/autodescription/` folder.
			* The deprecation class handler `deprecated.class.php` has been moved to the `/autodescription/inc/classes/` folder, from the `/autodescription/inc/deprecated/` folder.
		* These changes allow easy autoloading.
	* Some classes have their sub names changed.
		* The changes:
			* `AdminPages` is now `Admin_Pages`.
			* `DoingItRight` is now `Doing_It_Right`.
		* These changes allow easy autoloading and namespace interaction.
	* Some class files have been renamed.
		* The changes:
			* `adminpages.class.php` is now `admin-pages.class.php`
			* `siteoptions.class.php` is now `site-options.class.php`
			* `doingitright.class.php` is now `doing-it-right.class.php`
			* `termdata.class.php` is now `term-data.class.php`
			* `postdata.class.php` is now `post-data.class.php`
		* These changes allow easy autoloading and namespace interaction.
	* Two classes (and its files) have been removed:
		* `search.class.php`, which held `\The_SEO_Framework\Search` has been removed and its methods have been moved into `\The_SEO_Framework\Init`.
		* `transients.class.php`, which held `\The_SEO_Framework\Transients`, has been remove and its methods have been moved into `\The_SEO_Framework\Cache`.
	* Some function files have been moved.
		* The changes:
			* The deprecation function handler `deprecated.php` has been moved to the `/autodescription/inc/functions/` folder, from the `/autodescription/inc/deprecated/` folder.
		* This cleans up the folders and some code.
	* Not all classes are now always available. Unless methods of such are called or required.
		* This massively improves performance and reduces memory usage.
		* This completely changes the architecture of the plugin.
		* This is handled through autoloading, interfaces and magic methods.
		* Classes affected:
			* `Debug`
				* How this is handled:
					* The common publicly accessible (with public visibility, without "@access private" documentation) methods are set in [interfaces](http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.interfaces.php).
					* When an interface method is accessed, it will autoload the required class and the method will propagate to default behavior.
					* In general, this should improve performance and reduce plugin resource usage.
					* These changes shouldn't affect current code. If anything goes wrong, a "_doing_it_wrong()" notice is output. Thanks to magic methods.
			* `Deprecated`
				* How this is handled:
					* When an inaccessible method is called, the magic method `the_seo_framework()->__call()` fires.
					* Then the `The_SEO_Framework\Deprecated` class is autoloaded and cached within the magic method, quite like a singleton.
					* If the method is found in that class, it will be called with all parameters passed to it. Otherwise, a default "method doesn't exist" notice is output, which resides in the new Debug class.
	* Class `\The_SEO_Framework\Load` is now final, and can't be extended upon anymore.
		* I am aware that this essentially removes any possible access to protected methods.
		* This improves plugin consistency and prevents other plugins from creating very unexpected behavior.
		* Nevertheless, if you have a feature suggestion, you know where to find me!
	* Several methods have been changed, including:
		* Method `the_seo_framework()->post_status()`'s third parameter was unused. It's now used to echo (true) or return (false) the value, default return (false).
		* Method `the_seo_framework()->no_more_genesis_seo()` has been renamed to `disable_genesis_seo`, without deprecation as it was marked private.
		* Method `the_seo_framework()->page_inpost_box()` has been renamed to `singular_inpost_box`, without deprecation as it was marked private.
		* Method `the_seo_framework()->custom_field_redirect()` no longer checks for admin or front-end page status.
		* Method `the_seo_framework()->call_function()` is now marked private. It's written and used as an internal handler for filters.
		* Method `the_seo_framework()->generate_excerpt()` now has its third parameter (`$max_char_length`) default value increased by 1. From 154 to 155.
		* Method `the_seo_framework()->robots_txt()` has been moved to class `Init` from `Sitemaps`.
		* Method `the_seo_framework()->robots_txt()` is now called on action `init`, it was 'plugins_loaded'.
		* Method `the_seo_framework()->get_custom_field()` has been moved to class `Post_Data` from `Core`.
		* Method `the_seo_framework()->adjust_search_filter()` has been moved to class `Init` from `Search`.
		* Method `the_seo_framework()->build_singular_relative_url()` now continues to run if an empty Post ID has been suplied.
		* Method `the_seo_framework()->generate_the_description()` now always trims the output.
	* The `license.txt` file has been updated to improve readability. The contents have not been changed.
	* Error notices types generated by The SEO Framework's Debug class are now strictly checked before outputted. This yields no effective behavioral difference.
	* **Warning:** Settings sanitation handlers are no longer initiated on every admin page. This means that if you were to manually update the settings, the output will not be sanitized.
		* **Exception:** The sanitation handlers will however be initialized when using method `the_seo_framework()->update_settings()` or function `the_seo_framework_update_option()`.
	* License changes:
		* File `query.class.php` now falls under GPLv3 instead of GPLv2+.
	/
	* The settings reset query arg has been changed from `reset` to `tsf-settings-reset` and has been added to `wp_removeable_query_args`.
		* This also improves the canonical URL on the admin page, for whatever that's worth.
	* The SEO Settings updated notification query arg has been changed from `seo-updated` to `tsf-settings-updated` and has been added to `wp_removable_query_args`.
		* This as well improves the canonical URL on the admin page.
	/
	* Library changes:
		* `autodescription.{min.}js` is now `tsf.{min.}js`.
		* `autodescription.{min.}css` is now `tsf.{min.}css`.
		* `autodescription-rtl.{min.}css` is now `tsf-rtl.{min.}css`.
		* `the_seo_framework()->js_name` and `the_seo_framework()->css_name` now directly alter the called file.
			* Changing these public parameters would create 404 errors.
		* Added `tsf.externs.js` file, for closure compiler advanced optimizations.
		* Added `tsf.externs.protected.js` file, for closure compiler advanced optimizations when you require protected methods.
	* JS changes:
		* Constructor `autodescription` is now `tsf`.
		* Constant `autodescriptionL10n` is now `tsfL10n`.
		* Several Javascript constants are now publicly accessible, including:
			* `tsf.nonce`
			* `tsf.i18n`
			* `tsf.states`
			* `tsf.params`
			* `tsf.settingsChanged`
			* `tsf.hasInput`
			* `tsf.cropper`, which is only public for internal reasons.
	* Javascript l10n changes:
	 	* All translation strings are now captured in an object: `i18n`.
		* All page states are now captured in an object: `state`.
		* All parameter strings are now captured in an object: `params`.
* **Improved:**
	* Function `the_seo_framework_class()` will no longer change the plugin's flow if called before action `plugins_loaded`. Instead, it will return `false`.
	* Reduced sitemap's generation memory usage.
		* This means now 1200 posts, pages and custom post types can be generated without concern.
			* This is 3600 posts in total.
		* This means the previous sitemap transient has been invalidated. WordPress will clean this up automatically.
	* Method `the_seo_framework()->call_function()` now passes objects, so you can use `$this` in the called function.
	* Class overloading magic methods (`__wakeup()`, `__call()`, `__get()`, `__set()`) are now only initiated once and can't be reinitated or overloaded.
	* All admin actions have been moved into an admin action handler.
		* This massively reduces the plugin memory heap size of this plugin on the front-end.
	* All front-end actions have been moved into a front-end action handler.
		* This massively reduces the plugin memory heap size of this plugin on the back-end.
	* The debug handlers no longer checks for function `__`, as it should already be present when The SEO Framework has been loaded.
	* The inpost metabox has been moved into a view file.
		* This reduces memory usage on non-post edit pages.
	* The taxonomy and terms options output has been moved into a view file.
		* This reduces memory usage on non-term edit pages.
	* Method `get_latest_post_id()` now uses WP_Query instead of a direct database call.
	* WordPress' `is_ssl()` isn't cached. So now it has a cached counterpart: `the_seo_framework()->is_ssl()`.
	* The excluded post type filter no longer tries to match an exact value; saving some processing power generating the query.
	* Added multiple checks in the Breadcrumb generation code to prevent empty breadcrumb output.
	* When saving the SEO Meta data, all front-end transients now always flushed through a new method. Instead of guessing which options have been changed.
	* Removed several WP version checks that were aimed below the plugin WP version requirements.
	* Correct error notice titles are now in place for The SEO Framework's debug handlers. Rather than only `Notice:`.
	* Method `the_seo_framework()->call_function()` inaccessible method/function handler now uses the correctly assigned one, rather than using `_doing_it_wrong()`.
	* The Sitemaps Settings metabox' tabs output are now automatically determined.
	* Method `the_seo_framework()->parse_og_image()` no longer returns an emtpy string on second ID call.
	* Caching is now disabled on search pages.
	* Javascript: A JS extern file has been published on GitHub. This way you can overview the publicly stated functions there.
* **Fixed:**
	* Several CSS classes didn't have a correct prefix. These were, and now are:
		* `seoframework-content-no-js`, is now `tsf-content-no-js`
		* `autodescription-sep-js`, is now `tsf-sep-js`
		* `custom-title-js`, is now `tsf-custom-title-js`
		* `autodescription-js-confirm-reset`, is now `tsf-js-confirm-reset`
	* Method `the_seo_framework()->call_function()` now doesn't result in a fatal error anymore if the method of an object doesn't exist in conjunction with when the class is supplied as an object instead of string.
	* Function `the_seo_framework_get_option()` now has the required input parameters. Credit [QWp6t](https://github.com/QWp6t).
	* Method `the_seo_framework()->_doing_it_wrong()` now has correctly translatable notices. Credit [pedro-mendonca](https://github.com/pedro-mendonca).
	* The previously named "Knowledge Graph" netabox "Social Sites" tab title now is translatable. Credit [pedro-mendonca](https://github.com/pedro-mendonca).
	* Method `the_seo_framework()->get_user_meta()` now no longer returns a string when no metadata has been initialized. Instead it will return an empty array.
	* Globals `$blog_id` is no longer converted to string on post/page update.
	* Deprecation (filter and method) handler line call is correct once more.
* **Deprecated:**
	* Several term filter methods; The metadata transfer will be completed on this update. WordPress 4.4+ is now required:
		* Method `the_seo_framework()->get_terms_filter()`.
		* Method `the_seo_framework()->get_term_filter()`.
		* Method `the_seo_framework()->taxonomy_seo_save()`.
		* Method `the_seo_framework()->term_meta_delete()`.
		* Method `the_seo_framework()->can_get_term_meta()`.
		* Method `the_seo_framework()->get_old_term_data()`.
	* Method `the_seo_framework()->search_filter()`. It's a very slow method as it uses the (deprecated method) `get_excluded_search_ids()`. There's no replacement.
		* This method was already stopped being used in 2.7.0.
	* Method `the_seo_framework()->autodescription_add_option_filter()`. Use `the_seo_framework()->add_option_filter()` instead.
	* Method `the_seo_framework()->sanitizer_filters()` Use `the_seo_framework()->init_sanitizer_filters()` instead.
	* Method `the_seo_framework()->site_icon()`. Use `the_seo_framework()->get_site_icon()` instead.
		* `the_seo_framework()->get_site_icon()` can loop to itself once now if requested image size is an intval above 512, resulting it into being 'full' and then might set og image dimensions.
	* Method `the_seo_framework()->delete_transients_post()`. Use `the_seo_framework()->delete_post_cache()` instead.
	* Method `the_seo_framework()->delete_transients_post()`. Use `the_seo_framework()->delete_post_cache()` instead.
	* Method `the_seo_framework()->delete_transients_author()`. Use `the_seo_framework()->delete_author_cache()` instead.
	* Method `the_seo_framework()->delete_front_ld_json_transient()`. Use `the_seo_framework()->delete_cache( 'front' )` instead.
* **Removed:**
	* Memory profiling output in the HTML code when `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_DEBUG` is defined as true.
		* This was inaccurate at best.
	* Various methods regarding the Knowledge Graph settings metabox, these include:
		* `knowledge_metabox`
		* `knowledge_metabox_general_tab`
		* `knowledge_metabox_about_tab`
		* `knowledge_metabox_social_tab`
	* Many more methods have been removed, the default method invoking handler will notify you when called:
		* `add_filter`, use `add_option_filter` instead.
		* `s_one_zero_flush_rewrite`
		* `s_one_zero_flush_sitemap`
	* Methods deprecated in The SEO Framework 2.6.6 and below are now removed. Which gave you more than 6 months to catch up.
* **Other:**
	* Cleaned up code.
* **Filter notes:**
	* **Added:**
		* `(array) the_seo_framework_ld_json_breadcrumb_terms`. Used to filter the found terms.

		* `(bool) the_seo_framework_indicator_sitemap`. Used to allow for sitemap generation indicator.
	* **Removed:**
		* `(array) the_seo_framework_knowledgegraph_settings_tabs`. These tabs have been moved in the Schema metabox.
		* `the_seo_framework_detect_seo_plugins`. This was previously deprecated.
		* `the_seo_framework_supported_screens`. This was previously deprecated.
* **Action notes:**
	* **Added:**
